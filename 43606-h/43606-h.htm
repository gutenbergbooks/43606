<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>I present this book to the Public simply as an
account of what I did and saw; and the impressions
the different events and scenes made upon my mind.</p>

<p>I have written it from notes and my daily Journal.
The stories that are in it were told me, some by
Natives, others by Europeans; either over the camp
fire, or to while away the tedium of a long march, or
the <i>ennui</i> of life on board ship.</p>

<p>These tales must be taken as they are written; they
amused me much at the time, and if they only
interest my readers I shall be content.</p>

<p>I hope to revisit Abyssinia, but under more
favourable auspices; and trust that better luck may
attend me.</p>

<p>I have spelt the names of places as they are <i>pronounced</i>,
having had them repeated over several times
to me by our excellent interpreter, Peter Brou.</p>

<p class="o1">"In youth's wild days, it cannot but be pleasant</p>
<p>This idle roaming, round and round the world."</p>

<p class="i10"><span class="smcap">Goethe.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Not to trouble the reader with an account of the
route to India, viâ Brindisi, I will commence the narrative
of my adventures at Cairo, where most of the
party who were going to shoot in Abyssinia were
assembled.</p>

<p>We had a very jolly time of it at Cairo, and
amused ourselves in the usual way, by riding donkeys
through the bazaars and trying to win money from
the Greeks, who keep all the gambling-houses. Of
course most of the time was employed in making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
preparations for the journey to, and for travelling in,
Abyssinia.</p>

<p>We all went and paid our respects to the Khedive,
being introduced by Her Majesty's Consul, Major-General
Staunton. His Highness the Khedive was
very civil and courteous, and said he would give us
letters to the different Governors of the Egyptian
Provinces through which we were likely to pass. He
also provided all of us with firmans.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards we received invitations
to a <i>soirée théâtrale</i>, given at the Palace of Kasr-el-Nil.
This lordly "palace" is simply a large wooden
structure on the banks of the Nile, close to the great
barracks in which most of the troops of Cairo are
quartered.</p>

<p>The entertainment was particularly dull, and the
only thing that enlivened us at all was the excessive
crush of the company going up the wooden stairs,
which made the whole place shake. Just as we were
entering the room the floor creaked loudly, and the
company parted as if a shell had burst in the midst
of them; I thought the whole place was coming
down. Luckily, there was no panic, or I do not
know what would have happened, as we were at the
top of the house, having gone up about six flights of
stairs, and the room was full. There was an elaborate
supper afterwards, for which I did not stop. I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
only too glad during the first pause to leave so hot
an entertainment.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon we drove out to the Pyramids,
and ate lunch under some trees, sitting on one of those
broken Egyptian wheels which are used for raising
water. Afterwards we went inside the Pyramids; it
was very warm work, and we were forced to buy
quantities of antiquities, which, I believe, are manufactured
in Birmingham.</p>

<p>I found I had to take off my boots in scrambling
down a labyrinth of narrow passages inside of the
Pyramid to get to the King's Chamber, for I had
twice been thrown on my back through having nails
in my boots.</p>

<p>After having spent ten days at Cairo, I resolved to
start for Suez in order to make arrangements, and to
gain information about Abyssinia. By great luck I
met an Abyssinian merchant, quite a young fellow,
in the bazaar at Suez, who said he would go to
Abyssinia as my servant, and he turned out to be
very useful, as he could speak Amharic, Arabic, and
Hindustanee, as well as English. Petros, such was
his name, followed me through Abyssinia, and nursed
me with great care when I fell very ill on my return
to the coast.</p>

<p>I arrived at Suez just before H., who was to go
to Abyssinia with me; he had come from Southampton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
by the P. and O. steamer, and I was delighted
to have arranged so nicely with him as to suit our
mutual convenience.</p>

<p>I learnt that my provisions had all arrived safely
by the P. and O., but not my heavy guns nor ammunition.
What had become of them I could not make
out, as Rigby, of St. James's Street, had most distinct
orders in writing to send them to Suez. It turned
out afterwards that the P. and O. Company, through
carelessness, had sent the guns on to Pointe de Galle;
they arrived in Abyssinia the day before we started
for the Tackazzee, where the big game is to be found.
H. and I were hard at work for two days shifting
the provisions from the big boxes in which they had
come out into smaller ones, in order that these might
be carried on camels and mules. I bought a few
necessary articles at the P. and O. stores, such as a
large frying-pan, a common kettle, etc., for rough
camping work; most of the other things I had purchased
in London, and I would recommend all other
travellers to do the same. I bought all my provisions
from the Army and Navy Co-operative Stores,
Victoria Street; and I take this opportunity of
stating that, not only were they so well packed that
nothing was broken, but also that during the very
great heat and exceedingly dry cold winds in Abyssinia
not one thing failed, and every article of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
provisions came out as fresh as if I had sent for and
got it that day from the stores. The boxes in which
the stores were packed I had made from an army
pattern; it is the one used in the infantry to carry
the carpenters' tools.</p>

<p>A day or two after I had reached Suez, the rest
of the party arrived from Sheppard's Hotel, Cairo.
The ship we had to go in to Massowah, the seaport
town of Abyssinia, was called the <i>Dessook</i>&mdash;a ship
that had been running from Alexandria to Constantinople.
She possessed plenty of accommodation,
which is rather unusual for this line of steamers.
These vessels run every three weeks from Suez, taking
and bringing the Egyptian mails from and to Suez,
Souakim, and Massowah. It is an enterprise of the
Khedive's, and is called the Posta Khedive Company;
scarcely, I should think, paying well, as the trade
from all ports of the Red Sea is very small. They
also carry pilgrims during the pilgrim season.</p>

<p>We were a party of eleven on board the <i>Dessook</i>.
These vessels make no arrangements for providing
passengers with food; so we formed a "mess" of our
own, with a president and a committee. Of course,
we had a great many cooks, as the party was large
and we were going to separate; seven to disembark
at Souakim, and the remaining four at Massowah.
Nothing could have been merrier than our little mess.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>The only other passengers besides ourselves were
some French Roman Catholic priests with a French
bishop, and a Frenchman belonging to a house of
business in Massowah. The bishop was very pleasant
and intelligent, and gave the rest of the party and
myself a great deal of useful information as to living
and travelling in Abyssinia: he was Bishop of Keren,
in the Bogos country.</p>

<p>In about three days from Suez we arrived at
Souakim, which is built upon an island. The houses
are white square structures, with a minaret dotted
about here and there. I went on shore with H. in
the evening, and we walked about that part of the
town which is on the mainland. The inhabitants of
Souakim are Arabs; the men are very handsome,
well-made, likely fellows, and they walk about hand-in-hand,
twirling little crooked sticks and dressed in
white turbans and white clothes.</p>

<p>I bought one of those crooked knives peculiar to
Souakim with which the young gentlemen of the
place settle their little disputes. They hold the knife
dagger fashion, and hack away at each other till one
of the combatants faints from loss of blood. One
could see, from the shape of the knife, that it would be
very hard to inflict a mortal wound with such a
weapon.</p>

<p>Here seven of the party landed, including Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
B., Mr. Marcopoli, and Mr. Russell. They were going
up to the White Nile, by Berber, to join Colonel
Gordon, of the White Nile exploration. The other
four were going to Kassala, across the Desert, and
thence down to the Hamaram village mentioned by
Sir Samuel Baker in his 'Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia,'
to shoot all kinds of big game. The ship only
remained two days at Souakim, and then sailed for
Massowah. The rest of the journey was a little dull,
as the separation broke up this very cheery party, and
only four of us were now remaining.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 29th December, 1874, H.,
Lord R., A., and myself landed at Massowah, and
here I begin my journal with an account of our sport
and adventures.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 29, 1874.</i>&mdash;The first thing we did was to pay
our respects to the Governor. I presented the letter
which had been procured for me from the Minister of
Foreign Affairs in Egypt, and, of course, we had the
usual accompaniment of coffee. Arrekel Bey, the
Governor, was exceedingly civil, and said he would
do everything in his power to get us mules, etc., for
our journey to the interior.</p>

<p>Massowah is built on an island, in the same way as
Souakim; but there are two long causeways joining it
with the mainland, whereas at Souakim one goes from
the mainland to the town in boats&mdash;coarse-shaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
things, which are also used at Massowah, and which I
was told are not made in the country, but are brought
to Jidda by large steamers from India.</p>

<p>The boats, or rather rafts, that the people go out
fishing in in the harbour of Massowah are very primitive,
being made of a few logs of wood turned up at
the ends. The paddler is always wet with the sea,
but as he wears no clothes, except a rag about his
loins, it does not matter so much, the sun soon dries
him. These fishermen are more like fishes than human
beings, as they are in and out of the water every
minute.</p>

<p>All the export trade of Abyssinia comes to Massowah,
and the goods are mostly shipped by the
Hindoo Banians, who have had a monopoly of the
trade of this place for many years. The merchandise
is sent to Bombay, by Aden, in native boats called
sambouks. There is a pearl fishery off the island of
Dhalac, thirty-five miles from the coast of Massowah,
and the Banians make a good thing of it, paying for
pearls in clothes and those necessaries the natives of
the island are likely to want, and selling their purchases
for rupees at Bombay.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 30.</i>&mdash;The first day in camp was certainly uncomfortable
in all respects, as was to have been
expected, but we soon got straight, and then had
time to look about us. The hills of Abyssinia in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
distance, lying due west of our little camp, looked so
lovely as the sun set over them, one range rising over
the other, that I was eager to be off to see a country
that so little is known about, and whose people are
the only black race of Christians existing.</p>

<p>We pitched our little camp outside the town on a
small peninsula, close to where the Egyptian Government
is building a large house for the Governor.</p>

<p>There is no shade whatever near Massowah, and
the Governor very kindly got the Egyptian soldiers
who were told off to us as our guard, as well as his
servants, to put up a large mat "shemmianah,"<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>

which gave us a very pleasant shade during the heat
of the day. We always took our meals under its
shelter while we stayed at Massowah.</p>

<p>As I said before, my heavy guns had not arrived at
Suez, so my battery was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>One 16-bore central-fire gun, by Purdey, carrying
ball.</p>

<p>A muzzle-loading rifle, by Purdey, carrying 2¼
drachms of powder.</p>

<p>A 12-bore pin-fire shot gun, which I bought at
Suez from Captain Kellock of the P. and O., made
by Crane, of the Royal Exchange. This turned
out to be a most serviceable gun and a very hard
hitter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>These guns were rather weak to shoot the large
game with, but H. had brought his Rigby's "Express"
with him, which, he said, I could use whenever I wanted
to do so.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 31.</i>&mdash;We had all four settled the evening before
to go out shooting, and accordingly, this morning, we
started early for the lowest range of hills to be seen
in the distance. We expected to find some small
game, such as gazelles and small deer. I rode a camel,
and H. a donkey. Traversing the narrow causeway
which joined the little peninsula on which our camp
was situate to the mainland, the first thing that struck
me was the beautiful colours of the fish in the seawater
at each side of the causeway. A. got off his
camel and tried to shoot one, but the water was
rather deep.</p>

<p>On reaching the mainland we found ourselves in a
large open plain covered with stunted bushes, and in
the distance could be seen the village of Moncullu,
where the residents of Massowah go during the heat
of summer, which is very great in this climate.</p>

<p>H. and I made for the hills as quickly as we
could; my camel striding ahead took the lead, and
he followed on his donkey. The motion of the camel
is very pleasant; as I had bought a capital camel-saddle
in the bazaar at Cairo, so far from the motion
being inconvenient, as some travellers allege it to be,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
I found it very comfortable; it almost made me fall
asleep.</p>

<p>We saw no game on the plain we were crossing.
When we had got over the first range of small hills,
the guide, a Shoho Arab, stopped in the sandy bed
of a small river where some Arabs were watering their
flocks of goats. The water is got at by grubbing a
hole in the sandy bed of the river, and then the Arabs
scoop it up with a goatskin into a wooden trough, or,
failing that, into another hole made in the sand.</p>

<p>Here we stopped for a short time, watered our
beasts, and asked the natives if they had seen any
game. They said there was something in some bushes
close by, whereupon we were both on the tiptoe of
expectation. I got my rifle ready, and H. his shotgun.
We went towards the spot indicated, and,
almost among the herd of goats, I saw running about
a small brown-looking beast, like a very small deer.
We tried to stalk him, but he bolted past. H.
fired at him and missed; I then fired my rifle and
missed also. We then kicked him out of another
bush, but H. did not see him, he having broken cover
on the wrong side.</p>

<p>This animal turned out to be a little mouse-deer,
or dik-dik. In loading my rifle again, I rammed
down the bullet without putting in any powder, not
being accustomed to use muzzle-loading weapons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
This put one barrel <i>hors de combat</i>; thus the reader
will see that my first attempt at African sport was
not a success.</p>

<p>One of the natives then volunteered to show us
some bigger deer. We went on through a sandy,
rocky valley in which mimosa-bushes were dotted
about. H. agreed to go to the ground to the
right and I to the left, so as to work it over thoroughly.
The boy who was with me said he saw some
deer on the ridge of the high hill at the foot of which
I was; I went up the hill, and sent him round the other
way. On coming to the top I saw the deer feeding and
wagging their tails just below me, but they were too
far off for the rifle I had. I longed for my Express,
which, at that time, was on its way to Pointe de Galle
in Ceylon, instead of being with me! The deer
caught sight of me and trotted away. I sent back
the boy for H., as he had his Express with him;
when he joined me we tried to get at them again,
but failed. We saw another dik-dik, and then started
for home, in a temperature that was very hot indeed.</p>

<p>We were back in camp late in the afternoon, and,
having had something to eat, I determined to take my
rifle on board the <i>Dessook</i>, to ask the engineer, who
was an Englishman, to extract the bullet. Arrekel
Bey, the Governor, sent a boat round to our camp,
and the men rowed us out to the ship, singing, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
they were rowing, a wild Arab song which sounded
very prettily. It was a lovely moon-lit night, and
every dip of their oars in the water threw up waves of
phosphorescent light; which phenomenon everybody
who has been in these latitudes must have seen and
admired.</p>

<p>The engineer put my gun right in about half an
hour; he had to unscrew the block at the breech of
the gun. The Arabs rowed us home; they had to
carry us on their backs for a portion of the distance,
as our boat could not get near enough to the shore.
The native who was carrying H. managed to drop
him, and he got a ducking; I very nearly tumbled off
my Arab sailor, on whom I was riding pick-a-back,
from laughter, and I was very glad to get to bed after
a rather long day.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 1, 1875.</i>&mdash;This day we all four paid a visit
to Arrekel Bey, who said he had seven mules to
carry our things, and camels for A. and Lord R., who
were not going to the hills, but to the province of
Bogos, which formerly belonged to the Abyssinians,
and was taken from them by the Egyptians.</p>

<p>A., who had been in this part of the world before,
expected to find plenty of big game, as it was
a new country, and no English sportsman had shot
over it previously. I tried to buy a horse in Massowah;
Arrekel Bey's groom put him through his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
paces, showing him off up and down the space in
front of the Governor's house. It was very amusing
to see this Ethiopian sitting on the horse, with his
toes well stuck out, and displaying the points of the
animal, much in the same way as any London dealer
would in his straw-yard.</p>

<p>Arrekel Bey very kindly invited us to dinner for the
next day at Moncullu; he has a sort of little summer
retreat there. He said he was going to take us to
see the wells which supply Massowah with water.
The water is brought in earthenware pipes built up
inside the wall of the causeway, along which we had
gone the day before, and the water is pumped up from
wells in the rock by convicts transported hither from
Egypt. Massowah, before the conduit was completed,
was very badly supplied with water; in fact, there
was nothing but rain-water tanks, and the inhabitants,
even now, are charged for the water so much per
skin. We were to take all our luggage and baggage
to Moncullu, and then this party of four was to
separate; A. and Lord R. going to Bogos, and H.
and myself to Adowa, the capital of Abyssinia,
whence we intended to go down to Tackazzee for the
shooting. The reader will see, later on, that we had
to change our plans.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 2.</i>&mdash;This morning I prepared some fishing-tackle,
intending in the afternoon to try and catch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
some of the strange-coloured fish that I had seen in
the water the previous day. Fish of most beautiful
colours and extraordinary shapes and sizes abound in
all parts of the Red Sea.</p>

<p>A. had brought out some of the iron traps that
are used by keepers for catching rabbits in England.
I set one of these on the top of a heap of
stones near the camp, with a bit of meat tied on
the plate of it, to try and catch one of those great
vultures which are always seen hovering about Eastern
towns. In about half an hour one came swooping
down on it, made a "grab" at the meat and was caught
by the legs. He would have flown away with the
trap as well, but for Fisk, H.'s English servant, who
caught and secured him. He was one of the common
bare-necked vultures that live on carrion.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went out fishing, but did not find
much sport; I only caught a pipe-fish, which we ate.
That evening some of our mules and three camels,
as also a string of camels for A. and Lord R., appeared.
Arrekel Bey, the Governor, sent to ask if
we were ready; I said we were all ready, but that our
promised transport animals had not all come. In about
half an hour the Governor arrived himself, when I told
him that I could not start without a proper supply of
mules. He stated they could not be got that day, but
he would do his best the next day; I very politely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
said I would not move without my luggage. He then
ordered all the donkeys that are used to carry the
water into Massowah from the conduit just outside the
town to be brought. They were a mixed lot; some
were blind and some were lame, but our luggage was
carried into Moncullu some way or other. The great
thing was that we made a move in the right direction.</p>

<p>It was quite a sight to see this troop of animals,
consisting of camels, donkeys, and mules&mdash;the servants
pushing along the narrow causeway&mdash;one donkey lagging
behind, and another trying to push by&mdash;kettles
tumbling off and straps coming undone. <i>C'est le
premier pas qui coûte.</i> I am certain that it cost the
poor donkeys a great deal of pain, as they were
frequently belaboured with sticks and were loudly
cursed in Massowah Arabic.</p>

<p>Arrekel Bey took us to see the wells made in the
rock in Moncullu, where the most deliciously cool
water is pumped up. The convicts looked fine, strong,
muscular fellows, but gentlemen that one would not
like to meet alone on a dark night. They had just
left off work, it being sunset, six o'clock.</p>

<p>We then adjourned to dinner, which was laid out in
a large oblong hut made of grass. This is the way
that houses are made in Moncullu, as a free current of
air passes through the whole structure, and any other
material would be too hot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>We had a regular Turkish dinner, and not at all a
bad one either. We first began by drinking, as is the
Turkish fashion, some excellent liqueur which is called
in these parts "araké." I believe it is made in
Smyrna, but it is very good. As some of my readers
may know, a Turkish dinner consists of a great number
of dishes, which are handed about to the guests in
quick succession. I managed to get through most of
them, and I think I could have succeeded in doing
more, but for the circumstance that the champagne
had not been iced; in fact, ice in those parts is an
unknown luxury. It is only in India that Europeans
can really <i>live</i> in a hot country.</p>

<p>After dinner we were taken to a large marquee.
The ground outside was surrounded by a circle of
torches held in braziers, somewhat like a beacon,
burning wood which was replenished by the Egyptian
soldiers, a large number of whom had been "told off"
for this purpose.</p>

<p>There were divans in the marquee, on which we
reclined. We had waited about a quarter of an hour,
when some musicians appeared with tom-toms and
rude guitars, on which they began strumming, and
making a hideous noise. Then some dancing girls
were brought in, and their extraordinary performance
surpassed anything I had ever seen either in India or
at Covent Garden.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>The natives of Moncullu were ranged round the
open part of the marquee, singing to the music and
keeping time by clapping their hands. All the dancing
girls did was to sway their bodies about in an affected
manner, stamp with their feet on the ground, and wag
their heads backward and forward, making their long
plaited hair swing across their faces. They were
highly scented with musk, etc., <i>à la mode Arabe</i>.
Like all Arab women, they were very small but
beautifully made, with tiny hands and feet.</p>

<p>This entertainment lasted about three hours, and,
between the heat of the hut and the smell of the
negroes, I very nearly went to sleep. At last the
performance came to a close, and we retired to our
respective tents. The soldiers put out the lights, but
I could see Arrekel Bey's native servants, after we
were gone, regaling themselves on the remains of the
liqueur and brandy left upon the table in the marquee.
My head, the next morning, was not quite so clear as
it might have been. It must have been the Turkish
sweetmeats that caused it, I think!</p>

<p><i>Jan. 3.</i>&mdash;To-day we were all up at sunrise. Our
mules were loaded, and also our three camels. Two
more mules had arrived the evening before. H.
bought one, of a grey colour, for his English servant
to ride, and I was to ride a small brown mule.
She turned out a capital animal and very sure-footed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
over the rocks in the hills. We ate some breakfast
and started for Sahatee at eight o'clock, having said
good-bye to A. and Lord R.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
 I little thought on that
bright morning when we shook hands and wished
each other luck, that I should never see his cheery
face again. His death was indeed a sad, sad ending
to an expedition which began so pleasantly and well!</p>

THE TENTS.
</p>

<p>Before taking the reader any farther into Abyssinia
I must say something about our equipment; what
tents we had, and what description of provisions.</p>

<p>We took with us two tents; a three-poled tent
made by Edgington, and called by him the Punjâb
Hill tent. I should advise everybody to take this
description of tent for rough work in any country.
Head room is what is wanted for comfort; and this is
the only strong, portable, and shapely tent that combines
those advantages. Mr. Galton, in his most
useful little book, the 'Art of Travel,' says very
nearly the same thing. We had a little Union Jack
to fly at the top of it, and <i>iron</i> tent pegs. Of course
these tents can be made of any reasonable size. The
other&mdash;a <i>tente d'abri</i>&mdash;was for Fisk, H.'s English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
servant, and was for him to sit in while he skinned
the birds we shot, of which we intended to make a
good collection, as they are very beautiful in these
parts.</p>

<p>Ours was rather smaller than usual; our two beds
were on each side of a person entering the door, which
left a space at the head of the beds for a box for
brushes and dressing-things, etc.</p>

<p>We slept on iron camp-beds, and I was provided
with a blanket lined with silk, which is a device I
should recommend to everybody else, only advising
them to take care that the blanket is long and
wide enough to fall over the side as well as to
hang over the foot of the bed. The sleeper lies in
the fold of this blanket, so that if the sides were
tacked together it would make a complete bag; this
is good both for hot and cold climates. The lining
should be of red or blue silk, which is easily cleaned
with a sponge or piece of rag, and some warm water.
White, of Aldershot, made mine for the Cannock
Chase autumn man&oelig;uvres. It is almost waterproof,
and can be slept in with as much comfort as in the
best sheets.</p>

<p>Our provisions were calculated to last three Europeans
for four months. I had the list overlooked
by the head purser of the P. and O. Company in
London, who gave me some very useful hints with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
regard to preserving provisions. I cut down the
amount of stores as much as possible in order to
save transport, as, from what little experience I had
had of India and coolie work in that country, I knew
that the lighter one travels, the more comfortable one
is, and the farther one goes. The following is an
exact list of the provisions:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>1½ doz. tins of cabin biscuits (Peek and Frean).</li>
<li>1½ doz. tins of German rusks.</li>
<li>6 doz. small tins of cocoa and milk, from Lion brand.</li>
<li>½ doz. small bottles of currie-powder.</li>
<li>1½ doz. pots of marmalade.</li>
<li>½ doz. tins of plum-pudding.</li>
<li>One middle piece of bacon, cut up, and hermetically sealed in tins.</li>
<li>1 doz. tins of ox-tail soup.</li>
<li>½ doz. tins of <i>paté de foie gras</i>.</li>
<li>3 doz. tins of Cambridge sausages.</li>
<li>1½ doz. tins of sardines.</li>
<li>Two tin-opening knives.</li>
<li>14 lbs. of yellow soap, called "primrose soap."</li>
<li>8½ pint bottles of Worcester sauce.</li>
<li>6½ pint bottles of Harvey's sauce.</li>
<li>28 lbs. of preserved potatoes.</li>
<li>3 bottles of best French vinegar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></li>
<li>12 lbs. of tea, done up in 1 lb. tins.</li>
<li> 1 doz. bottles of mixed pickles.</li>
<li>18 2-oz. pots of Liebig's extract of meat.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cocoa and milk in tins was one of the most
useful of the provisions we had, as it only required the
addition of hot water to make a most delicious cup of
cocoa. This was very useful when starting early in
the morning and things were wanted in a hurry, and
it was quite a meal by itself. German rusks I would
also recommend, as they are very good eating, and do
not dry up the mouth so much as biscuits. Of course
these provisions were helped out a great deal by fresh
meat, milk, eggs, bread, etc., which we found in the
country. Besides all this, we took a large sack of
onions, about two donkey-loads of rice, some potatoes,
some salt for table use in bottles, and some black
pepper and mustard. Coffee of the very best sort can
be got at Massowah. We took a little sugar with
us, but it was not properly packed, and all melted
together in one compact mass. The best way to take
sugar would be to have pounded loaf-sugar done up
in pickle bottles or tins.</p>

<p>With regard to the cooking, H. had a large tin
box which contained a canteen made by Thornhill, of
Bond Street; into this all the boiling cans and a
small kettle fitted, the one into the other. I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
not recommend this arrangement for <i>rough work</i>, as if
a can gets bent it does not fit into the other, which
is a disadvantage, as it then has to be carried separately,
and eventually ends by being knocked to
pieces. The best kinds of things for the cook are a
common gridiron, a large frying-pan, three sizes of
pots made of <i>strong</i> tin in the shape of milk-pails for
boiling in; a good tin kettle, a soup-ladle, and a
couple of butcher's knives. With those one may go
anywhere.</p>

<p>With regard to knives and forks, the best sorts are
those that are made by Thornhill, of Bond Street, for
skinning animals, but they answer other purposes as
well. All steel things, in a hot, dry climate, can be
very well cleaned and polished by the natives with
the wood ashes out of the camp-fire, and there is no
reason why they should look dirty, for dirty things
always take away the appetite, especially if you
have sometimes to eat rather strange food. The forks
I had made from my own pattern, and two of them
can be converted into a fish spear on an emergency.
It is a great thing to try and manage to have such
implements as may be made to serve more than one
purpose; as the reader will understand, this saves a
great deal of carriage.</p>

<p>H. brought out two English hunting-saddles; they
did very well for the mules we rode in Abyssinia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
He also brought snaffle-bridles; these were a great
deal better than the bridles of the country, which are
dreadfully severe and pull any animal back on his
haunches with the least touch. This is rather dangerous
on a narrow path over a precipice, as sometimes,
going uphill, by mistake a rider is apt to hang
on by the bridle instead of catching hold of either the
mane or the pommel. The mules took to the snaffle
very kindly; in fact, it seemed quite a relief to them
to have this description of bit in their mouths.</p>

<p>As so much has been written upon mules lately,
with regard to their use as draught animals for farm
purposes and in other ways, I copy from my notes
made on my way home some memoranda of the
way these animals are treated and looked after in
Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Everybody in Abyssinia rides a mule; even the
king rides a mule, and has his charger led in front of
him. This custom is followed by all the nobles and
"swells" in the country.</p>

<p>The saddles used on Abyssinian mules are made
with high cantels and pommels, and are well padded;
a good sheep-skin Numbdah, or one made of old
cotton cloth, folded into many folds&mdash;the older and
the more ragged the better, as it is then softer&mdash;is put
under the saddle. On the march, when the halting-place
for the day is arrived at, they take off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
saddle but not the numbdah, tying up the mule in the
shade for about half-an-hour to let the animal get cool.
They then remove the numbdah and lead the mule
to roll. The best place for this purpose is in the
ashes of an old camp-fire. In fact, in Abyssinia there
are regular rolling-places for the mules and donkeys
at most of the camping grounds; the animals seem to
know them by instinct, especially the patient ass,
which latter is used merely for carrying baggage.
Anybody riding an ass in Abyssinia would be hooted
through the country. This is rather extraordinary, as
these animals, among the Arabs, and also in Egypt,
are considered quite the thing, and large donkeys of
good breed fetch very high prices in Cairo. I myself
saw one at Suez that had cost at Cairo 40<i>l.</i>, but he
was made like a race-horse.</p>

<p>After the mule has rolled they take him to water;
they next hobble him, and let him go out to graze.
The best sort of hobble I have ever seen, and one
used in Abyssinia, is one by which the near fore leg is
tied up with a leather thong, about three-quarters of
an inch wide, to the off hind leg, or <i>vice versâ</i>. The
thong must be so tied that the mule can walk pretty
easily, and yet it should not be too loose.</p>

<p>These remarks apply to donkeys as well as to
mules; but, of course, the former animals do not
require so much care as mules. They need not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
hobbled when let out to graze, but should always have
a man to look after them in case of attacks by wild
beasts.</p>

<p>In travelling with these beasts the great thing, of
course, is to avoid sore backs in this country, where
the temperature varies so much in different parts;
as, for instance, I was out duck-shooting one morning
at 5.30 in a white frost, and at the next camping
ground, at a less altitude, at the same hour of the
morning, I could not bear a thick coat on at all when
walking out shooting.</p>

<p>This change of temperature occurring very often,
day by day, while travelling with these animals
through Abyssinia, must have, I think, some effect
on the backs of mules and donkeys. The origin of
the swelling under the skin, I am persuaded, must
depend on the sudden check to the perspiration.
Of course, if the saddle or packing had at all bruised
the back of the animal, this would accelerate the
complaint.</p>

<p>The back having become sore or swollen up, matter
is formed underneath.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
 To cure this the natives of
Abyssinia cast the donkey or mule, and with a hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
iron score the back. In two days the wound begins
to discharge matter; after a few days more, the
sore should be washed once or twice every twenty-four
hours and dressed with <i>fresh butter</i>. The back
becomes much harder after these wounds have healed
up, but it requires at least a month or more to do
so, and the animal should be kept within doors or in
any enclosed space, and fed on corn and green food,
as the discharge from the wound is exceedingly
weakening.</p>

<p>Some merchants of Abyssinia, who travel daily
for months down to the coast from distant parts, much
prefer mules and donkeys whose backs have been
burnt, as, they say, the animals are hardier, and the
soreness and swelling are not likely to recur.</p>

<p>As to our camels, they were with us only a short
time, for they left us at the foot of the hills; my
experience of camels, therefore, is not very great.
All that I observed was, that it is best to leave them
to the cameleers; but to see that the cameleers, when
loading up at starting, are not trying to shirk their
loads and put the things told off to <i>them</i> on their
neighbours' camels. This is a favourite expedient,
and they will tell any lies and swear any oaths to get
rid of a pound or two of baggage, especially if the
camel is a favourite one with them.</p>

<p>With regard to the mode of packing mules and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
donkeys, it would take up too much space to give
an account here. All I would recommend to the
traveller is to follow the custom of the country in
which he finds himself. He should not interfere with
the natives in loading, as, most likely, he will thereby
only display his ignorance, and they will get annoyed
and sulky at being interfered with. Sir Samuel
Baker, in his 'Nile Tributaries in Abyssinia,' gives
an interesting account of the mode in which he loaded
his donkeys for starting to Central Africa.</p>

<p>Now, to continue our journey. The plain on which
we had been encamped soon ended, and then we began
to ascend the hills. The ground was very rocky
and arid, only stunted bushes growing here and there.
We then came upon a small valley which reached to
the bank of a sandy river-bed, with rather thick
jungle on each side. One of the servants said we
should be likely to find some game here. I got off
my mule and walked up the bed of the river, telling
the man with my mule to go straight on with the rest
of the party, and that I would rejoin them after
making a slight détour. After I had gone a little
way a dik-dik crossed the dry river-bed in front of
me; I fired at him, but it was too long a shot. I
then tried to circumvent some guinea-fowl, with
which the jungle fringing the banks of the watercourse
abounded; they made the whole place alive with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
their calling to each other. They are exactly like
the guinea-fowl one sees at home, and make precisely
the same noise. They did not let me approach them
within shooting range, being very shy. I successfully
stalked a hare and knocked him over, he was
of that description of animals which our American
cousins call the jackass rabbit; I leave it to naturalists
to give his Latin name. We ate him for dinner,
and he was capital food.</p>

<p>I then trotted on in front of H., and arrived at
Sahatee, the place we were to camp at for the night,
about one o'clock in the afternoon. My first thought
was to get something to drink, as I was very thirsty;
therefore, obtaining some oranges from a native, of
these I sucked some, and squeezed the juice of
others into my little silver bowl; they were very
bitter, but greatly refreshing.</p>

<p>Before I go on, let me recommend travellers to
take these small silver bowls with them; it is
wonderful how useful they will be found. The bowl
can be applied to many purposes, and is easily
cleaned with fine wood ashes. One makes one's
tea in it, covering it over with a plate to make it
draw; one drinks one's soup out of it, or coffee or
cocoa, as the case may be; and one mixes one's
medicine in it. Silver is a very good metal for
things to be made of, as if it is bent it is easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
brought into shape again. One of the gun-bearers
should always carry the bowl, so that the traveller
may have it at hand to dip into the stream and drink
from; the brightness of the silver shows whether the
water is fit to drink. In Abyssinia the natives do
not understand silver vessels, and set no value on
them, thinking they are tin; but in other countries
they might easily be stolen.</p>

<p>The camping-place of Sahatee is surrounded by
rocks. There are two trees on a little knoll in the
centre, and it was under one of these I was lying
when H. appeared with the camels, the tents and
baggage. We pitched the little tent in the bed of the
dried-up river, whence, during the rains, the water
dashes over the rocks and flows away to the sea.
After we had had something to eat, H. said he was
going out shooting, one of the Arabs in charge of
the camels telling him that wild pigs abounded here.
He had not long gone out of camp before I heard
the crack of his rifle. He had wounded a boar in the
hind quarter, as it was coming to drink; but the boar
trotted away, leaving blood tracks, which H. and
the Arab tried to follow up, but soon lost them in
the dust and the hard-baked ground of the jungle.
When I heard the shots I started off also to try
and find a boar, but was not so lucky. I got back
about an hour before dusk, and saw several of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Francolin partridges pecking about the camping
ground; I killed one and wounded another. H. had
just come in, and as the wounded bird rocketed
over his head he knocked it down. H. also shot a
small brown duck. I had tried to get some of
the little sand-grouse as they came down to drink;
but these little birds only come down just as it is
getting dusk, and settle quickly on the ground,
uttering their peculiar plaintive cry. It was almost
impossible to discern them in the fading light, and as
I wanted to get a pot shot into the "brown" of them
as they were on the ground, for the cook to prepare for
our breakfast next morning, I waited too long, the
light failed, and I had to give up my intention.</p>

<p>We were camped on the shingle of the river, which,
although it is always a very dry, clean spot, and
free from insects, has this disadvantage, that the
iron legs of the camp-beds sink rather far into the
ground; and sometimes one wakes up finding oneself
in a slanting position, with the head lower than the
legs.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 4.</i>&mdash;This morning we were on the move early,
having left at 6.45 for Ailet. It was a lovely, cloudy
day, which is a thing that one knows how to appreciate
in an Eastern climate. The country became
much greener as we approached Ailet; this village lies
in a valley which is exceedingly fertile&mdash;that is to say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
as far as it is cultivated by the Shoho Arabs who
dwell in the village. Elephants are found here after
the rains, but the place is rather unhealthy at that
time, and most of the natives, who are miserable
creatures, suffer from fever.</p>

<p>I should state that the Governor had provided us
with a guard of six irregular Egyptian soldiers and a
non-commissioned officer. In the middle of the night at
Sahatee, we had heard the loud report of the Egyptian
corporal's carbine. We thought we were going to be
attacked; but it turned out, next morning, that he
had fired at a pig, in hopes of securing some fresh
meat.</p>

<p>These poor soldiers' pay is four dollars a month;
they find themselves in clothes and food, but are
provided with arms, and all military service is compulsory
with the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Our cameleers and Naib Abdul Kerim&mdash;the man
whom Arrekel Bey, the Governor, had given us to guide
us through the country and manage our transport as
far as Adowa, the capital of Abyssinia&mdash;wanted
us to camp near a large tree just outside the house
of the Sheik of the village of Ailet. H. and I, however,
agreed to go on, so as to get to the hot springs
of Ailet, as it was early in the day and we should
be a little farther on our journey; we should also
be farther away from the village and more likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
to get shooting. After some little palaver and
remonstrances from the cameleers, who thought they
had come to the end of their day's march, we
moved on.</p>

<p>The scene now changed from an open valley into a
thorny jungle, and the road was frequently crossed
by dried-up river-courses. H., who had already
acquired a fine collection of birds in Ceylon and
Australia, was very anxious to secure specimens here.
This jungle was alive with all varieties of parti-coloured
warblers, and he shot several specimens, including
a sort of jay with a hooked bill, which utters
a strange cry&mdash;one that everybody travelling in
Abyssinia will soon get accustomed to. It is not
unlike the noise of the English jay.</p>

<p>We shortly afterwards came to a little stream which
flows from the hot spring; and we saw a white house
in the distance perched on the top of a high hill, for
which we made. The little stream narrowed as we
advanced, and we found ourselves in a rocky pass.
Our Arabs told us that the camels could go no farther.
The white house, as we learnt, belonged to some
Swedish missionaries. We pitched our camp just at
the foot of the hill which rose straight above us, the
little white house looking very picturesque at its top;
the hot spring was about ten minutes' walk from our
camp. One of the missionaries came down to speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
to us; he said that they had only just finished
building their house, and he hospitably invited us to
stay there, but we declined, with thanks.</p>

<p>H. said he would go out shooting, but I stopped
in camp to settle things, and before dinner I went up
and bathed in the hot spring. My readers must
know that this is the fashionable Spa of Abyssinia,
whither invalids afflicted with scrofulous and other
complaints come to bathe. It is held in great repute
all through the country, and I believe with good
reason.</p>

<p>The spring was almost too hot to sit in, but I had
taken up my big sponge, and douched myself well;
the bath was very soothing after the heat and march
of the day.</p>

<p>This evening it began to rain; this will give the
date of the beginning of the rains in the hills lying
between the sea and Asmarra, the first table-land in
Abyssinia that one comes to on this road. These
rains must not be confused with the rains that pour
down in Abyssinia, supplying the Nile tributaries that
Sir Samuel Baker has explored, and which begin in
the month of May.</p>

<p>Directly the rain began the servants and myself
busied ourselves in making a little trench around the
tent; this is a precaution everybody ought to take
where there is the least chance of rain. I also got my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
<i>courbatch</i><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
 and thrashed the tent well all round. The
reader will, doubtless, wonder why I did this, but it is
an old soldier's dodge, and the reason for it is that
it makes the threads of the canvas&mdash;which, in hot
countries, become shrunken and open&mdash;to close
together, so that, after the application of the <i>courbatch</i>,
the tent, instead of getting leaky with the rain,
becomes more waterproof than before; a large pliable
bundle of twigs will do just as well. H. came in,
having shot a small bird or two for his collection, and
having seen some pig down the watercourse.</p>

PARADISE&mdash;LOST IN A MIST&mdash;A "NASTY CROPPER"&mdash;SAFE IN

</p>

<p>I had heard at Massowah that General Kirkham,
commander-in-chief of the King of Abyssinia's army,
was at Gindar, about half-a-day's march from Ailet. I
had written to the General from Massowah, and, this
evening, a servant of the missionaries brought me a
note from him, saying that he would come and see us
next morning. I was very much interested in seeing
General Kirkham, who had lived so long in Abyssinia
away from his own country.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jan. 5.</i>&mdash;We got up rather late the next morning,
and H. went out shooting. I said I would stay in
camp and receive Kirkham when he came, but he did
not arrive after all till the afternoon; so, having waited
for him until twelve, I decided to go out shooting.
I proceeded down to the watercourse, and had not
gone far before I came to a pool, at which some pigs
were about to drink; I tried to stalk them, but they
trotted away. I then turned sharp to the left into
the jungle, and wandered about some little time.
One could not well imagine a more likely place for
wild game, and I expected every moment to see
some strange animal dart out of the bushes.</p>

<p>The air was very hot. I had walked about an hour
and a half, and I determined to rest and eat some
sardines and a crust of bread which I had brought
with me. I got on the top of a little mound, and was
discussing my luncheon, when I heard a sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
sneezing noise behind me. This made me prick up
my ears; I looked round and saw walking quietly
out a beautiful little male dik-dik. I rolled him
over with my shot gun, pulled out my knife and
rushed after him. He was struggling and bounding
about on the ground when I got up to him, when
I made several vigorous stabs at him with my
knife, but, to my great chagrin, he scampered away.
I ran after him, getting well torn by the bushes,
and found him lying dead just at the foot of a thorny
bush. This was the first African animal I shot,
and, although he was so small, I felt as proud of him
as a cat would with her first mouse.</p>

<p>At the time the dik-dik came out I heard pigs
grunting in a little dell below me, but I could not see
them at all. I went back to camp, and hearing that
Kirkham was up in the missionaries' house I sent
word to him that I had come in. I was sitting in
the tent when suddenly I saw a fair, rather good-looking,
slim man walking up to me; he was dressed
in a frock-coat and forage cap&mdash;a sort of undress
general's uniform. It had a very strange effect to see
this man walk up to one in an African jungle&mdash;his
dress, too, not such as one would expect to see in
those parts.</p>

<p>We soon became the best of friends. He told me he
would do everything in his power to get us shooting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and forward us through the country. We had a very
pleasant little dinner in the tent, talking over our
prospects; Kirkham said he would breakfast with us
next morning, and then go on to Gindar. At this
place he has built a sort of wooden shanty; he had
also brought his tent with him to make arrangements
for us. He was attended by an Abyssinian servant,
named Peter Brou, a man who had been educated at
Malta; this man spoke English very well, and could
also speak Amharic, all the Abyssinian dialects, and
Arabic. Kirkham recommended us to take him as
our servant, which we did; he turned out very useful,
and was one of the best interpreters I ever knew.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 6.</i>&mdash;After breakfast, and when Kirkham had
left us, the weather having cleared up, I went out
shooting, and walked through the jungle down to the
village of Ailet. The boy who was with me was an
Abyssinian Mussulman, living at Massowah, but he
seemed to know all the Shoho Arabs in the village.
I went into a house to look at the interior and see
what it was like; it was an oblong structure built of
grass, divided by a grass screen into two chambers,
the door of the screen being covered by an Arab
cloth. The Arab women, who were grinding corn,
amused themselves by peeping at me through the
ragged holes in the cloth; they were very civil, and
brought me a cup of coffee. I ate my lunch and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
started with two of the boys of the village, sent by
their father to show me the place where I might find
"pig." I did not see anything, but my Massowah
boy annoyed me very much by coolly firing at some
guinea-fowl with my 16-bore gun loaded with ball,
so I told him that the next time he did that I should
give him a good thrashing.</p>

<p>I then walked on towards the little stream running
from the hot springs, rather disappointed and tired.
Going through the jungle I put up a dik-dik hind;
this animal trotted away out of shot range, and then
stopped and looked at me. I had read in some book
of African sport that the curiosity of deer is extraordinary,
so I squatted down and twirled my
gun about much in the same way as signallers do
with a signal flag. To my great astonishment the
little dik-dik pricked up her ears, and gradually
making little circuits approached within range; it
seemed almost a pity to shoot so pretty a little
animal, but I fired and rolled her over.</p>

<p>On my way towards home I heard in the jungle
some people chattering; they were the women of
the village of Ailet, gathering and cutting firewood. I
was walking on when two very pretty and gracefully-shaped
girls stepped out from the bushes; they were
stripped to their waists in order to work more easily.
Mahomed, the Massowah boy, seemed to know them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
for both of them came smiling up to him, saying,
"Ah, Mahomed, how are you?" and he kissed them
both. This young gentleman seems to be quite a
Lothario, and knows all the girls about here. When
the ceremony of kissing was over the girls saw me for
the first time, and retreated like two startled gazelles.</p>

<p>Dik-dik flesh is very good eating; it tastes better
roasted when one has bacon to add to it. The best
way to cook the haunch is to lard it well with bacon
fat and then roast it in Turkish fashion, skewered
through with a stick.</p>

<p>The above applies to gazelles as well, as these
animals have no fat except round their kidneys. This
is also the best way to cook all birds, but the larding
may be omitted.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 7.</i>&mdash;This morning, having bade adieu to the
missionaries, we started for Gindar by a short cut
across the hills. The missionaries are making this
road, but the jungle is not all cut yet. Our guide
was Brou, the interpreter that Kirkham had given us
as a servant.</p>

<p>Having travelled up the gorge, we passed the hot
spring. Here the missionaries have built a little
house for the poor sick who come to bathe. Pushing
our way through thick thorny jungle we came suddenly
on a beautiful valley, green and fresh-looking, with
high hills in the background, one of which we were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
cross to reach Gindar. In the distance, on the side
of a hill, might be seen the station of Sabargouma,
where three or four Egyptian soldiers are stationed
to look after the customs and Egyptian interests.</p>

<p>On descending the valley I resolved to try to
shoot, as it looked a likely place for game, so I got my
rifle and gun and started with Mahomed, the Massowah
boy. Kirkham had given us a black, fat-tailed
sheep of the Asmarra breed, a celebrated one in
Abyssinia; this animal followed me and assisted at
the death of another dik-dik. We never killed this
black sheep for eating, and he accompanied us all
through Abyssinia and became a great pet in camp.
I found H. at Sabargouma, where we had a little
gin and water. Fisk said he saw a large hyena, but
the cunning brute soon slipped out of sight. He shot
a specimen or two for his collection. We then started
to ascend the steep hill in front of us; this was a
lovely ride, and it reminded me very much of the
Himalayas without the beautiful rhododendrons that
grow there. The latter part of the ride was through
an olive grove. The air on the top of these hills is
most exhilarating; I felt able to do anything, and
my mind was busy imagining all kinds of sport and
adventures in such a lovely country. About one in
the afternoon we entered the small valley of Gindar.</p>

<p>Before I go on with the journey I wish to say a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
little concerning Gindar, and what General Kirkham
proposes doing there. Gindar is a fertile valley enclosed
by hills; south-south-west lies Debra Bizen,
which rears its head high above the rest of the hills.
There is a monastery on the top, and the monks are
said to be rich and in great favour with King Johannes.
The grass in the valley is very good; at the time I
speak of, the Shoho Arabs had driven their flocks
here to graze; and their cattle-stations are found
dotted about in the little vales between the hills.
The grass of the valley is intermixed with numerous
sweet-smelling herbs, such as wild peppermint,
thyme, etc.; the castor-oil plant also grows wild
here.</p>

<p>The sides of the hills are covered with wild olive
groves, and in places we came across velvety lawns
which reminded us of a well-kept English pleasure
ground rather than the wilds of Abyssinia. Game is
abundant, and elephants were in the neighbourhood,
as the hunters from Adowa had been here. One of
them having broken his clumsy matchlock, was obliged
to return to get it mended. Koodoo, gazelle, dik-dik,
and other antelopes abound, as well as many
large pigs, and, as the Irishman is made to say,
guinea-fowl and partridges here "jostle each other."
This was, of all others, the place for us, so we determined
to stay for two or three days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>Gindar has been given by the king to General
Kirkham, who has built a house, and has also allowed
the missionaries to build one. He intends trying to
start a bazaar and small town to supply travellers
going and coming to Massowah; and also to supply
the Abyssinian merchants with the little European
necessaries they require there without having to go
into Egyptian territory to buy them, which at present
they have to do at Massowah.</p>

<p>I thought I would take a turn with my gun; it was
a misty evening, and too late to go out shooting. I
wandered over the hills, and, the light failing, I was
"making tracks" for home; it got darker and darker,
and the mist got thicker. The little Galla boy that
Kirkham had sent with me to show me the way, was
a stranger to these hills; he never lost heart once nor
spoke a word: at last he uttered a sort of whine; I then
knew I had better trust to myself. I had seen, about
a quarter of an hour before, the light of the fires of
an Arab cattle station; I resolved to try and see the
light again; so I fired my gun off twice to attract the
attention of those in camp, but I was between hills,
and they did not hear. I was pushing through the
wet bushes when down I slipped, head over heels, on
some creeper-covered rocks, but I picked myself up,
with no harm beyond a fright. I was determined to
find the light again; and, forcing my way through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
jungle, as it was getting intensely dark, all of a sudden
I again fell. This time I fell about twenty feet. The
Galla boy was more careful, and, seeing me fall, crept
along on his hands and knees, feeling his way as he
went. I clutched hold of the creepers that grew on
the rocks, and picked myself up. I heard water
gurgling beneath, and I thought to myself it was lucky
I did not fall farther, for I might have fared worse
this time. I lost my felt hat, but the most extraordinary
result of these false steps was that my little
16-bore gun, which I had with me, was not the
least hurt, although it received several serious blows
against the stones. At last I caught a glimpse of the
welcome light. The cattle station was in a little vale:
the smell of the cattle now guided me, and I soon
found myself alongside of the thorny hedge that
surrounded these camps. The women were preparing
the evening meal, and when they saw me without any
hat, and looking rather scared, began to laugh. This
I thought unkind, so I pushed through the thorn
hedge and went straight to one of the little fires. An
old Arab was squatting by it. I was streaming with
perspiration, and very thirsty. I asked him for a
drink, and he brought me some water in a wooden
bowl; no iced champagne ever tasted so good, and
I swallowed it all; then I took off my coat to dry,
having made up my mind that I was to stop here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
for the night. At least here was a fire and a chance
of some food&mdash;better than the wet jungle in any
case.</p>

<p>The old Arab seemed to understand I was going
to make myself comfortable for the night, and he went
and fetched two others, younger ones, and by signs
and saying the word Gindar, I made them understand
that I was lost. They said they would show me
the way home if I gave backsheesh. I showed them
the empty lining of my pockets; one does not generally
take out small change when going shooting in
Africa, but this only shows how useful it is. At last
they agreed to show me the way for a dollar, and
the Galla boy and myself started for home; about
half-way we met a Greek that Kirkham had sent
out to look for me, carrying a lantern, accompanied
by some native servants. I soon reached home, and
Kirkham congratulated me that my first adventure
in Abyssinia had not ended worse.</p>

<p>Our little dinner was a pleasant one, as it was increased
in number by the presence of an ex-French
navy captain who had joined the Commune and now
was an exile in Abyssinia. He was a wild-looking
old fellow, but a wonderful talker; and he and I
chatted away gaily. He had come from Adowa, and,
having very little money, was nearly starved on the
road. He looked very pinched, and certainly disposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
of a wonderful amount of our preserved provisions
with great gusto.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 8.</i>&mdash;This morning I went out to look for
pigs. I was wandering about the jungle, when I saw
an animal on some rising ground, quite the size
of a donkey. Whether it was the position of the
ground or that the old boar&mdash;for such it turned out
to be&mdash;was very large, I do not know; at all events
I mistook him for a donkey, and did not fire. He
whisked up his little curly tail and trotted off, followed
by his spouses and some squeakers. I ran up, but
they were soon lost in the thick bushes. Naturally,
I was dreadfully annoyed, and resolved to let fly at
everything in future.</p>

<p>I saw no end of guinea-fowl, but did not fire, being
on the look-out for larger game. After wandering
about for an hour or so, I came to the little vale in
which the cattle station was, the scene of my adventure
of the night before.</p>

<p>An old sow and two squeakers were there, enjoying
the green grass. I came on them rather suddenly, and
the squeakers trotted off, but as the old sow moved
after them, I broke her back with a ball from my little
16-bore Purdey; she was a very old lady, with good
tusks. Both the boars and sows in this part of the world
have fine tusks; the boars' tusks only differing by
being larger. She died very game; and as I twice drove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
my knife into her throat, she was very quick with her
tusks and once nearly caught my shin. I lost the rest
of the afternoon's shooting, having to send back the
only boy I had with me to camp, to ask for people to
carry the game home. We had liver and bacon for
breakfast the next morning, and it was excellent;
also pork chops.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 9.</i>&mdash;This morning, after breakfast, I went
out shooting, accompanied by Brou, and saw some
dik-dik, but did not fire at them, as I had already
killed three specimens. We came to a large hole
in a bank, not unlike a fox-earth, and I heard some
beasts running about inside, which Brou said were
pigs. I never heard of pigs going to ground before,
but he assured me they did so in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>He and I set to work to stop the hole, and we put
a boy over it to watch. I retired to a shady spot, and
told Brou to go home and send me out some lunch,
and bring people (some of our bullock-drivers and
donkey-men) to try to dig out and unearth the pigs, or
whatever they were. In due course of time the lunch
appeared, and, shortly after, Brou, with some Shoho
Arabs, our drivers. We tried very hard to get at the
animals, but they beat us; the earth was too deep, and
ran in among roots; the soil also was very hard for
digging with such wretched tools as the Arabs brought.
I longed for an English ferreter with his spade.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>A Greek, named Aristides, who is engaged here
for cutting wild olives for the Khedive of Egypt,
came to see Kirkham. This Greek employs Abyssinians
to cut the wood and send it to Egypt, where,
I am told, his Highness uses it for parquet floors.
I induced him to mount a spear-head I had brought
out with me, on a stout stick, and it looked very
well and serviceable. He said he would go out
shooting with me next morning; and, as he knew
every inch of the ground round Gindar, I was
delighted.</p>

<p>The following morning we both started off at cock-crow,
while the dew was on the ground, for a hill lying
behind Kirkham's shanty, which he had built here.
It was rather steep walking, but a lovely morning and
as fresh as possible.</p>

<p>The Greek was in front of me tracking up a herd
of Hagazin or Koodoo, when he suddenly stopped and
aimed at something with my rifle that he was carrying
for me. I stepped up as gently and quickly as I
could, took the rifle and fired at a red-looking deer;
the animal dropped like a stone. I rushed down the
steep bank, and found the bullet had gone right
through its head between the horns. I could not
account for this, as I had aimed behind the shoulder.
The Greek said that at the moment I fired, the deer
turned its head round and looked at me; as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
animal was standing a good deal below me, this must
have been the case.</p>

<p>It was a wonderfully lucky shot; as, if the deer
had bounded a few yards away wounded, the bushes
in this part were so dense that it would have been
rather hard to find the game. This antelope turned
out to be a bush-buck, called in Abyssinia Doucoula.</p>

<p>The Greek and I then went to the top of the hill,
having cut up and skinned the deer and sent a boy
home with it; it was a heavy load for him. My companion
showed me a little bird, the honey-bird, that
kept flying backwards and forwards in front of us,
seemingly to lead us on. Aristides explained to me
that this little bird not only leads on sportsmen to
the nest of the wild bee, but also to the lairs of wild
animals. Shortly afterwards the Greek stopped, and I
noticed he had seen something; they were the koodoo
we had been tracking up, though I did not see them
myself.</p>

<p>When we got to the top of the hill the view was
lovely. The valley of Sabargouma lay in the distance,
and beyond it the low hills between us and the sea-coast.
We then returned to camp, and on the way
back I took a shot at a pig with my little 16-bore gun.
We had a haunch of the venison for dinner; it was
very good, but without fat.</p>

<p>The rain poured down the best part of the night;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and, unluckily, we had put our beds at that end of the
shanty which was most leaky. I woke up and found
myself enjoying a shower-bath from the roof. H. was
much in the same plight, and we were both glad when
morning broke.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 12.</i>&mdash;A good breakfast and some hot cocoa
soon warmed us up, and we started for Beatmohar,
the place where General Kirkham has a house.
This is the first table-land of Abyssinia that one
comes to, travelling by this route. Our luggage
was now carried by mules, donkeys, and bullocks,
driven by Shoho Arabs. It rained the whole day, so
the view of the hills was spoilt, which I regretted
very much. At the sides of the hills at the feet of
which the path wound, it was covered with a gigantic
Euphorbia, called Qualqual in Abyssinia; it is a sort
of cactus, or grows like cactus, to the height of forty
feet or more. When its branches are wounded, a
milky juice oozes out, which is highly poisonous; if
the least drop gets into one's eye it nearly blinds
one. In India, in 1870, when shooting in the Himalayas,
I was amusing myself with my hunting-knife
by slashing at a plant, very much like this one; a
drop of the juice squirted into my eye. One of the
hunters, a native, brought me a sort of creeper with a
leaf much like a vine. He screwed up the stalk of it,
and catching the juice in the palm of his hand, offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
me some, and told me to put it in my eye; it afforded
instantaneous relief. I do not think this cure is
known to the Abyssinians, as their woodcutters sometimes
lose their eyesight. Later in the day, as we
reached a higher altitude, we saw no more of this
poisonous plant. We travelled on slowly through the
mist and rain, the bullocks slipping about over the
rocks, and frequently having to be reloaded, or
the leather thongs which bound their baggage
tightened up.</p>

<p>At last we came to an open dell in the hills, one of
the camping-places on this road, called Mehdet. Kirkham
and myself with great difficulty, and after wasting
a number of matches, managed to light a fire, and we
warmed up some cold venison, frying it in oil that
Kirkham produced. H. did not like the dish, saying
that it tasted like hair grease; he preferred the
venison <i>au naturel</i>: we ate a box of sardines, and
then started again. The road became very steep; at
four in the afternoon we reached the top of the pass,
a narrow gully between high rocks: there would be
just room for two men to walk abreast.</p>

<p>The road after this for a short way was very good,
like a good hill-road in the Himalayas. At the bottom
of this road was a small valley, called Maihenzee: this
was to be our camping-place for the night, and one of
the stages between Asmarra and Gindar. This was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the place where merchants from the interior generally
stop on their way to Massowah.</p>

<p>There was good water in the valley; we pitched
our tents, but everything was wet and miserable.
Kirkham told us that to-morrow we should be out of
these rains, which I was very thankful to hear.</p>

<p>The cook Ali, a Cairo man, who, like all his species,
did not relish this sort of life, but wished himself on
board a comfortable <i>diabeha</i> navigating the Nile and
smoking cigarettes in the sun, made a bad fire, and I
saw very little prospect of dinner. I had to take his
place; and I concocted some soup with the help of
Liebig's extract, and I made a venison stew. We
ate this and then turned in as quickly as we could,
before our blankets got wet with the mist.

</p>

<p><i>Jan. 13.</i>&mdash;We made an early start this morning,
as it was a lovely day, and left the tents behind to
stand and dry, as they would have been very heavy
to pack wet. The General accompanied us; he would
have looked a queer figure on an Aldershot field day.
He wore an undress general's uniform, with a large
sword clanking by his side, sitting on an Abyssinian
saddle with rather faded trappings; he rode a
mule, the sword clanking against every rock on the
narrow path. We saw some partridges on the road,
and I had a crack at one and wounded it, but it soon
made away. Kirkham jumped off his mule and
rushed after the bird, sword and all, to finish it off
or catch it; but these birds run like hares, and the
game was soon lost in the thick bushes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>We went on ascending, and as we did the vegetation
became thinner and thinner. At the top stunted
yew-trees grew, so it must be cold here at most seasons
of the year. We then went over some low hills, and
at length found ourselves on a large plain, with cultivated
land here and there. A flock of large cranes
were flying round and round; at last they settled
on a bit of ploughed land not far from the road.</p>

<p>I rode towards them and tried to stalk them, but
they would not let me come very close. I fired my
16-bore gun into the "brown" as they rose, but it had
no effect. I would recommend all future sportsmen
to take out wire cartridges with them: one never
knows what one may come across in a wild country,
and a wire cartridge at close quarters would act
like a bullet, and for long shots of course they are
capital.</p>

<p>In the distance might be seen the village of Asmarra;
the houses flat-roofed and built into the side
of the low hill on which the village stands. About
ten or twelve of the natives came out to meet us;
they saluted us respectfully, and we touched our
hats. They had come out not only to meet us but also
to stop our baggage-bullocks from coming any farther
than the top of the hills, as there was cattle disease
among the herds of the Shoho Arabs, and an order
had been issued all through Abyssinia that no cattle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
were to travel, or be allowed to go to or from infected
districts: this is worthy the notice of our sanitary
commissioners at home. Kirkham had trotted on, to
make arrangements at his house for us. We left the
village of Asmarra, and on our left the ground fell; as
we rode on we passed several pools. In the distance
flocks of fat-tailed sheep might be seen cropping the
short grass, they were of the breed spoken of before,
and celebrated throughout Abyssinia. One fat sheep
costs a Maria Theresa dollar;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
 but two small ones
can be bought for the same money.</p>

<p>We saw Kirkham's little house, with a roof like an
extinguisher, in front of us; it was perched on a high
cliff that overlooked the plain, which was dotted
about with water-pools. Kirkham had told us they
were famous places for ducks, and sometimes snipe.</p>

<p>We soon arrived at the house; it was surrounded
by the usual hedge to be seen round all Abyssinian
houses; this hedge is not growing, but made of thorn-branches
and stakes. The few houses which composed
the village of Beatmohar were close by. Kirkham
at once produced some honey-wine, called "tej"
in Abyssinia; it was excellent, and proved very refreshing
after our ride. "Tej" is made in the following
way: to one part of honey are added seven parts
of water, and well mixed; then some leaves of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
plant called "geshoo" are put into the mixture, to
make it ferment; it is put outside in the shade and
left for a day or two. A piece of cotton cloth is
strained over the mouth of the large earthenware jar,
or "gumbo," and through this the "tej" is poured;
the servant tapping the cloth with his fingers to make
the liquid run freely. If one wants to make it stronger,
the first brew is used instead of the water; adding
honey and geshoo leaves in the same way. In the
time of King Theodore that monarch had tej five
years old, which made any one drunk in a very short
time; but those were the "good old times" which
we read of.</p>

<p>We ate some lunch, and I took out my gun and
went for a stroll; I shot a large blue crane, and saw
some ducks. I went out again with H. in the evening
to look out for ducks; a flock of teal just as it was
getting dark came whistling over my head, but I was
not quick enough for them. On my way home I shot
an owl, which I presented to Fisk for stuffing. He
informed me it was identically the same as the barn
owl at home. I was rather disgusted, as I thought an
Abyssinian owl must be different from the home
species; but he insisted that he had shot lots of them
in Norfolk, and said the skin of it was not worth the
carriage home. Over this I got rather "chaffed," so
I resolved not to shoot any more Abyssinian owls. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
believe it is considered very unlucky to shoot an
owl!</p>

<p><i>Jan. 14.</i>&mdash;This night we were very comfortable,
sleeping in a sort of divan that Kirkham had put up,
round the inner room of his house. It was a great
relief to know before turning into it that the sleeper
would not be the unwilling victim of a leaky roof.</p>

<p>We had settled, H. and I, and Fisk, to go at
dawn of day to try and get some duck in a pool
just at the foot of the high rock on which the house
stood, so next morning off we started. It was bitterly
cold and a white frost on the ground. We crept down
to the pool and let fly all six barrels into the middle
of the flock. Sad to relate, only three fell, which were
not picked up; one of Kirkham's Galla boys was sent
down later in the day and discovered two.</p>

<p>We then proceeded up the pools; I flushed a
snipe and knocked him down, he was rather a lean
specimen of his kind. On our way home I saw those
large cranes again coming towards me, so I squatted
down as close to the ground as I could and waited;
the flock kept coming on, making a great noise and
screeching, but they saw me and wheeled away.
One old gentleman, rather in advance of the others,
wheeled rather close to me; I let fly my 16-bore
No. 1 shot: it did not seem to affect him in the least,
when after going a little way, all of a sudden he fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
like a stone. I ran as hard as I could and found him
quite dead, with his backbone cut right through by
the shot; how he could possibly have kept flying in
this state I do not know. His shank-bones will
make excellent pipe stems.</p>

<p>The rest of this day we were engaged in again
shifting our provisions, etc., into skin bags; as boxes
are very bad things to carry either by coolies, mules,
or donkeys. It is the custom in Abyssinia to have
all one's baggage, as far as possible, packed in these
bags, and then the coolies do not mind carrying
them so much. A box is so hard it hurts a man's
shoulder when he carries it, and as for mules and
donkeys it means sore backs at once; besides, the
leather thongs that bind the box on to the mule are
always slipping. We paid a Maria Theresa for two
of these bags, and found it rather difficult to get
them. Kirkham had gone to Asmarra to make
arrangements for coolies, and when he came back, he
said everything was completed, and that we should
start to-morrow at sunrise. Vain hope, as the reader
will see; for, instead of starting at sunrise, we started
at sunset. The people who dwell in the gorgeous
East have no idea of time, and always think that
Europeans are in a hurry, and that to-morrow will
do as well as to-day.</p>

<p>We had sent a message to Belata Keda Kedan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the chief of this province: he lives at a town called
Tzazega, about half a day's journey from Beatmohar.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 15.</i>&mdash;In the morning no coolies appeared:
one of the "chickers," or tax collectors, or head-men
of the village, was very insolent; he brought three
coolies, and asked an exorbitant price. I said I
would not give it; he then walked away laughing,
followed by the coolies, saying, "Well, you won't get
them at all now." I thought to myself, "My friend,
you shall pay for this." I then politely asked him to
walk into our enclosure, shut the door, and made a
prisoner of him; put a guard over him, and told him
he should wait.</p>

<p>Kirkham's and the Galla boys were delighted; they
thought, the young rascals, there was a chance of a
fight. We waited till the afternoon, when, coming
across the plain, we saw the chief, followed by a large
retinue, some on mules, some with shields, spears,
and guns, holding little plaited straw umbrellas over
their heads. I made arrangement that only the chief
himself and a few of his followers should be allowed
inside our little enclosure. When he arrived I met
him at the door, and escorted him inside the house.
We then told him all that had happened, and had the
prisoner brought in. The chief questioned him, and
then ordered him outside to be thrashed; but he was
not punished, as he implored to be let off, and said he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
would use his best endeavours to get people of the
village to carry our baggage. We gave our Egyptian
soldiers a present, and they went back to Massowah.</p>

<p>We here changed our plans, as K. said it was only
a waste of time going to Adowa on our way to
the shooting on the Mareb and Tackazzee, and we
might do it coming back. Eventually, after the
chief's soldiers and followers had hunted up the
villagers, and dragged them, kicked them, and beat
them, they were made to carry our baggage. We
started about one hour before sunset, the coolies
having gone in front. The reason that the soldiers
treated the villagers in this way was, that the king,
who was far away, had heard there were some
Englishmen coming into the country, and had given
orders to the chiefs or governors that we were to
be treated with respect, and everything that we wanted
done for us.</p>

<p>We travelled across a large table-land with not a
vestige of foliage to be seen, and no sound to be
heard but now and then the bleating of the sheep as
they were driven to their pens near the villages for
the night. The moon rose, and we very soon found
ourselves near a village called Adouguada. All our
coolies had stopped; the lazy fellows had scarcely
been travelling for two hours; they had handed our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
baggage over to the head-man of the village. This
is a usual mode of proceeding in Abyssinia; one is
passed on from village to village, and if the villages
happen to be close together the day is spent in
quarrelling and in looking over and counting the
baggage. When I rode up they were all talking at
once and making a horrid noise, as is usual on such
occasions. I asked for a hearing, and informed the
villagers of Adouguada that if they did not carry our
baggage I should take two cows and two sheep
from the village, and stop there all that night with my
servants; under these circumstances they would have
to provide us with bread, etc. Brou, the interpreter,
advised me to do this; he said, "It is the only way
to get on, and you are travelling in the king's name,
and can have what you want." H. then came up
with K., and we procured something to eat and some
coffee. The villagers made much noise and gesticulation,
and then at last picked up <i>half</i> our things
and went off.</p>

<p>We then started for Sellaadarou, the place we were
going to camp at that night. It was bright moonlight,
and the moon in the East, as some of my
readers probably know, appears very different from
our moon at home. It was a beautiful ride, but a
little cold. We arrived at Sellaadarou about nine
<span class="s08">P.M.</span>, or perhaps a little later. K., like an old soldier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
as he was, pitched the camp just outside the village,
in a sort of little garden that the villagers had made
to grow their capsicums in; it was surrounded by a
thick thorn hedge, made of boughs cut from the
thorny acacia. This hedge provided us with wood
without any trouble; so we made two large bonfires
to warm ourselves, ate some supper, and turned in
after a long worrying day. The other half of the
baggage had not come up when we retired to our
tents.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 16: Sellaadarou.</i>&mdash;After breakfast this morning
I went out shooting, taking with me a native of
the village to show me the way. I "put up" some
partridges, among them a young florican, which I
shot, much to the astonishment of the Abyssinian.
They never can make out how birds can be shot
while on the wing, as their plan is to get as near
as possible, and then "pot" the birds on the ground&mdash;a
very good one too, if the sportsman is hungry. I
never knew before that there were floricans in Abyssinia;
there are plenty in some parts of India. The
bird was delicious eating. I saw two dark mouse-brown
deer, but could not get at them, and, of course,
for a long shot I wanted my Express rifle. When I
came into camp I found that some of the villagers of
Sellaadarou had carried on a few of our things.
H. had been round the village with some of our servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
to beat up the natives; he said it was great
fun running from house to house trying to catch the
men, the women swearing that their husbands or
sons were away. Abyssinian servants, on occasions
like these, always filch any little things they can
quietly lay their hands on, and bring them to their
master afterwards; I had on several occasions to
punish servants for this, and make them take the
things back. H. started in the afternoon with a little
more of the baggage. I told him we must force our
way on, and, as he was now on the move, to go as
far as he could. It will be seen afterwards he did a
capital march.</p>

<p>Chickut was the name of the village K. told us
we could camp at. It was rather a short march,
and I knew H. would go farther, for we had been
very much annoyed by these continual delays, so we
agreed that he should go on to the next village
beyond Chickut. K. then went back to Adouguada
to fetch up the other half of our baggage left behind;
I said I would wait for him. Time went on, and
it got later and later. Fisk, who had stayed with
me, said he would go out and try to get something
good for dinner, in case we should have to stop
the night here. Just at sunset I saw K. in the
distance, kicking his old mule along as fast as he
could; he rode up and said Maria Theresa had won
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the day&mdash;meaning the dollars. "All right," said I;
"let us have something to eat&mdash;then we must start
and make a night march of it." Fisk then came in
and we made some soup.</p>

<p>There was nobody to carry the few things that
remained here, so we determined to use our mules as
pack animals and walk; and a nice walk it was, too.
Fisk's white mule, bought at Massowah, declined to
keep the baggage on her back, and twice kicked all
the things off, scattering them right and left. Among
them was the spirit case and medicine chest; thank
goodness, neither were broken. I had them made
after my own fashion, so this was a severe test for
them. The white mule had to be ridden after all,
and poor K. had to give up his riding-mule to carry
the things. We started an hour and a half after sunset,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>

and walked well right into Chickut, where we
arrived about eight <span class="s08">P.M.</span> The whole village was in a
deep sleep, and we were only greeted by a few barking
dogs.</p>

<p>The road from Sellaadarou to Chickut is very
rugged, and is a steep descent, but it was a lovely
moonlight night, and what we could see of the view
was glorious. Euphorbia, and the wild olive, formed
a great feature in the magnificent scenery. Poor K.
stuck to the walking well, but he had on a thin pair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
of button boots, which were rather trying to his poor
feet over the rocks. He would insist that H. had
stopped at Chickut, but I knew very well that he had
gone on. I then told him what I had said to him
before we started. We had some cold soup we
brought with us, and shared a small biscuit between
us. H. had taken all the provisions on in front with
him.</p>

<p>The road descended more or less steeply from
Chickut to Deevaroua, and at last we came to the
Mareb. Here it is a small stream, and rises in a
high mountain about four miles from this place. K.
told me that the ground at the foot of the mountain
was swampy, and that there were springs as well all
the year round. This river Mareb is the Gash of the
country in and near Kassala. In its course across
the desert to Kassala its waters are absorbed by the
desert sands, but it is a foaming, muddy torrent
during the rains. This is one of the Nile tributaries
of Abyssinia, mentioned in Sir Samuel Baker's book.
I wish I had been able to fix the source of this
river exactly, but I had no instruments or other
appliances with which to work; I hope to do this
eventually.</p>

<p>The village of Deevaroua, where we were to stop for
the rest of the night, was on the top of the gorge
through which the little stream of the Mareb runs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
A large and most beautiful tree, of the species <i>Ficus
Indica</i>, spread its branches near the stream. From
this we drank excellent water, and then went up to
the village. After a little wandering about we found
where H. had pitched K.'s tent, which he had taken
on with him; all were asleep and snoring. I had a
good mind to "draw" H., but it was a quarter to
eleven, so I let him repose in peace. K. roused up his
Abyssinian cook, Blanche<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
 by name, and she made
us some coffee. The servants pitched our tent, and I
turned in, very tired but not exhausted. It has been
shrewdly observed of the air on these hills, that it
is "like champagne, minus the headache."</p>

<p><i>Jan. 17.</i>&mdash;We all took a "long lie" this Sunday
morning, it being a day of rest, and when we did
get up we found ourselves encamped near the village,
and close to a little Coptic church. The view was extensive,
while across the table-land, which was intersected
by watercourses that looked like broken ditches,
might be seen three pointed rocky hills which rose up
out of this bare plain and formed a marked feature in
the landscape. On the side of one of these hills
nestled the village of Terramnee,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
 which was to be our
next halt. After breakfast we agreed to go and see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
the Coptic church, so we sent to the priests to say we
were coming to pay them a visit. They replied in a
short time, saying they were ready to receive us, and
met us at the gate of the enclosure which surrounds each
of these churches; we then walked up a narrow path
to the church door. The priest and his two attendants
all bowed down and touched the threshold of the
church with their heads before entering; it was a
round edifice, with the usual "extinguisher" roof. A
narrow passage runs round the inside of it between
the outer wall and the "holy of holies," the entrance
to which was covered by a sort of ragged curtain.
The outside wall of the "holy of holies" was covered
with rude frescoes&mdash;St. George and the Dragon, the
Virgin Mary, etc. The Virgin was portrayed with
very large eyes like saucers; St. George was a meek-looking
creature, sticking his spear into the dragon,
but looking in an exactly opposite direction. Rude
frescoes, very similar in style, may be seen at the
parish church of Chaldon, near Caterham, in Surrey.
As we were coming away I saw some long stones
hung up by grass ropes on a pole, supported by two
short sticks; I asked what they were. They said these
were used instead of church bells. They were musical
stones, in fact, which, when struck, gave out a very
pretty sound; they were chosen so as to make a
scale of three notes. We gave the priest a dollar for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the good of the church, at which he seemed pleased
and astonished.</p>

<p>At Deevaroua I bought a large cured cowskin, to
make sandals for our servants when we got into the
jungle. This I would recommend travellers to do, as
the sharp grass and thorns are too much for even the
horny feet of the Abyssinians, and the cowskin
proved of great use afterwards.</p>

<p class="caption">A RACE FOR A SPEAR.<br />
<span class="s08"><i>To face page 70.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>About mid-day I started alone with Brou, who was to
show me the way to Terramnee, and to get coolies there
to carry on our things to Koudoofellassie, when we
should be out of this province, which we have had so
much difficulty in getting through. I saw a ballaga<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
coming towards me, the mule he was riding kicking
and plunging about as viciously as ever I saw any
animal do. I said to myself, "I must make the acquaintance
of this gentleman;" so I rode up to him
and said, "How d'ye do?" and asked him to let me
look at his spear. While I was looking at it I edged
away, then, giving my mule a good kick, galloped off
as hard as I could, spear and all. He was quite taken
aback at first, but soon began chasing me. We had
a nice little spurt, but, as bad luck would have it, one
of these watercourses was in front of me, and the way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
across it lay to my left, which would bring us almost
together. He saw his chance, and whipped up his
mule, who had the legs of mine, and caught me;
I then pulled up, and he asked for his spear. I
delayed a minute or two, and then began laughing.
He seemed to understand the joke, and I gave him
back his spear; he told Brou, who was following
after me, that he really thought I meant to take it
away from him. I heard them laughing a little way
behind me. Abyssinians are very cheery fellows,
always ready for a joke, provided it does not touch
their pockets.</p>

<p>When we reached Terramnee I sent for the chicker,
or head-man of the village, and they said they would go
and fetch him. There was an assembly of natives in
the village, all jabbering at once. I asked Brou what
it was all about, and he said it was a dispute between a
man and his wife; one party takes the wife's part,
and another the husband's; judges are appointed,
and they "jaw" away as hard as they can. Several
natives had come in from neighbouring villages about
this. At length, when it was over, they had the
civility to attend to me: the old story&mdash;the chicker
could not be found; he was in the fields; they had
sent for him, etc. I asked, "Where's his house?"
They showed it me, and I went up to it. The old
gentleman was at the bottom of the hill which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
had gone up, and in a friend's house. I told him I
wanted men to carry our things to Koudoofellassie,
and he said he would do his best, but he was not
chicker over all the village, and would send round
to the others. H. and K., with luggage and servants,
came up, and then we had a nice row; the
chickers vowed they would have our things carried,
but the natives would scarcely obey the chickers. I
called my old friend, whom I had first seen, and
told him that if we did not go on that day I should
take him a prisoner to the chief at Koudoofellassie,
in whose province the village of Terramnee was. Bit
by bit our luggage was picked up and carried on;
only the heaviest part of it remained.</p>

<p>The day wore on, and we got more and more
impatient. At last the chicker said, "The people
will not obey us; you must go round the village and
beat them up with your servants." The natives
were hiding away in any available corner. H. and
I went into one house where we had been told
there was a man; the house was quite dark inside,
having no windows or openings of any sort. We
struck a lucifer&mdash;I do not suppose they had ever
seen one before. H. descried a man in a corner
and pulled him out, but he turned out to be an
aged priest, exempt from doing coolie work. The
old fellow was much disturbed, but we apologised and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
said we were very sorry, and he retired to his corner
quietly but grumpily. Such visits as these to the houses
of the natives reminded me very much of what is stated
of the English soldiers hunting for rebels in 1798.
We managed to get a good number of the natives
unearthed. Directly one was caught he was sent off
under care of one of our servants to where our after
baggage was lying; a package was given him, and he
was started for Koudoofellassie immediately. The
only thing that now remained was H.'s large tin
case. Tuckloo, one of the chickers, said there was
not a young man left in the village. I said, "It
must be carried, or I tie you to my mule and take
you into Koudoofellassie to the chief." He considered
a moment, and then another man and himself slung
it on a pole and carried it off. H., Fisk, and myself
now started "by moonlight alone" for Koudoofellassie.
The road lay across a plain almost all the
way, so we galloped our mules along at a great pace:
the old fellow, Belata Keda Kedan, sent with us
to guide us safely through his province, shouting
at us and telling us to take care of the holes as
we rode. We raced into camp about ten <span class="s08">P.M.</span>,
yelling and shouting, being guided by the light of
our fires.</p>

<p>We found the camp pitched and dinner ready; K.
had gone in front and done all this. Borum Braswouldeselassie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the chief of this province, was waiting
by the camp fire for us; a pleasant-looking, middle-aged
man, who had seen good service with the king.
He said anything we wanted we were to ask him for,
and he would come the first thing in the morning
and see us again.

</p>

<p><i>Jan. 18.</i>&mdash;To-day, after breakfast, I overhauled most
of my things, guns, fishing-tackle, etc., and put them
in good order. The old soldier that Belata Keda
Kedan had sent with us was much interested in all
he saw. I asked him if he would like to go to
England. He replied, "I would go to your country
if you would give me lots of tej and araké, and
nothing to do." It was very amusing to see him
admiring his face in a little toy looking-glass that
H. had given him. He was to leave us here (Koudoofellassie),
so we gave him a present of ten Maria
Theresa dollars, and he went his way rejoicing.</p>

<p>Borum Braswouldeselassie had come to see us
before breakfast; he did not stop long, as he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
he had to go with his soldiers and followers to attend
the feast of Baptism. On this day all the population
of the town go down to the river and bathe; the
priests pray, and I believe bathe also. After we
had taken breakfast Brou told us that if we went a
little way out of camp into the town we should see
the priests and procession returning from the river.
We stood on the top of a high mound, and very soon
heard a most discordant braying of horns in the
distance. The procession now approached, the priests
bearing the sacred image of the Virgin, with a canopy
held over it; little boys were walking in front with
incense. They were singing a monotonous chant alternately,
the women all taking it up at one time and
the men at another. Borum Braswouldeselassie and
his horsemen were in front of the procession, galloping
about with their horses and firing off their guns.
The whole thing, except for the horsemen, looked
very much like a Roman Catholic procession. They
marched past us up to the church, and we saw them
no more. K. said that on occasions of this sort
the Abyssinian horsemen play a game called <i>goux</i>,
so I begged of him to send a message to Borum
Braswouldeselassie, asking him to send some of his
soldiers to play the game, in order that we might see
it. About three or four came out on a flat piece of
ground, which was the market-place, and commenced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
galloping their horses at full speed and throwing their
sticks at each other like spears, receiving them on
their shields. I believe there is a Turkish game,
called Jerrid, which is much the same thing. Their
horses were wretched specimens&mdash;thin, bony screws,
that could not gallop as fast as a person could kick his
hat. I asked one of them if he would let me get up
and try the game. So one of my servants asked,
"Will you lend the Feringee your horse?" He said,
"The Feringee! oh no," and galloped away as hard
as he could. When we had seen this, we determined
to go and pay a visit to Borum Braswouldeselassie.
We found him just about to sit down to his dinner,
and he asked us to join him. My readers must not
imagine a table and chairs at this entertainment, as
the dinner was held in a stable; Borum Braswouldeselassie
and his family sitting on the ground. The
first thing they began to eat was some "tef"&mdash;a sort
of spongy, sour bread, made in large thin cakes. This
they dipped into a paste of red pepper, and ate it with
their fingers. Borum Bras. had some very good "tej,"
of which we drank. There was also some stewed meat,
which was broken up in bits by the servants with
their fingers, and then the dish was given to the lady
of the house, who divided the portions equally and
handed them to each member of the family as well as
to the guests. The enormous quantity of bread and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
red pepper of the most pungent kind which Abyssinians
manage to get through is something extraordinary;
they wash it down with plenty of "tej,"
which is a capital thing to take away the fiery heat the
red pepper creates in the mouth. The correct thing
to do at an Abyssinian dinner is to take a large
bit of bread or meat in your hand and stuff it into
your neighbour's mouth; this is considered the acme
of good manners; also, your first glass of "tej" is
generally handed to you by the master of the house.</p>

<p>In the evening H. and myself went out shooting,
K. having told us that there were some grouse in
the low hills near camp, and I shot at a young
bird, but missed. The old cocks were calling just in
the same way they do on a Scotch moor&mdash;the same
note, but not quite so strong. I tried to approach
some more, but it was very steep walking in some
places, and the birds were exceedingly wild.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 19.</i>&mdash;To-day was market-day at Koudoofellassie,
and Brou and myself, on our way to our
next camp, stopped under the shade of a small tree
round which the market was held. The people were
coming in fast with honey and butter, corn of different
sorts, sulphur for making powder, etc. etc. The
country folks directly they arrived squatted down in
a line. I tried to buy a jar of honey, but of course
they stuck on the price for the Feringee. About
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
eleven <span class="s08">A.M.</span>, or perhaps a little before, I started with
Brou for Adgousmou, the next village we were to stop
at. Goubasee, who was my gun-bearer, walked the
whole time in front of my mule; I stopped under a
tree for about fifteen minutes and then went on. This
was a long march, and we were going fast. Goubasee
eventually turned out to be, as I had thought he
was, a wonderful walker, always in front of everybody
in the longest march, and never shirking any difficulty
that came in his way; in fact, he was a most faithful
and useful servant, the only Abyssinian among our
crew whom I could really depend upon. The country
we were going through was table-land intersected by
broad ravines.</p>

<p>My servants pointed me out two large trees in the
distance; near these they said was the village of
Adgousmou. Abyssinian servants have quite an original
way of provisioning as they march along.
If they pass any cornfields, particularly the Indian
<i>gram</i>, they run into the corn and take as much
as they want, not only for their own eating, but
for their master's mules. This is done regardless
of the shouts and imprecations of the boys who
are sent out from the villages to watch the corn,
perched in some places on a high heap of stones, in
others on a rude platform supported on forked poles.
This same <i>gram</i>, if the pods when quite green are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
well-boiled, makes an excellent substitute for peas.
Before going up to the village of Adgousmou we
crossed a stream, where I shot a spurwing and a pigeon
very like our common wood-pigeon, only not quite
so large. I killed these birds in case H. should not
turn up after my arrival with the tents, provisions,
etc. I then rode into the village and asked for the
chicker. He soon came, and was a fine-looking old
man. I asked him for some bread for my servants;
he said he had none&mdash;a reply that was plainly untrue.
He then sent for a bowl of sour milk, which
was very nasty. I gave it to Goubasee, who soon
polished it off and seemed to enjoy it immensely.
The old chicker and I sat in silence for some little time
enjoying the view, at least I did, and at length I arose
and went away, as I saw no prospect of getting anything
out of the old niggard. I settled the camp
should be near some trees outside the village; a ruined
village also, probably the old village of Adgousmou,
was close by. I made the servants light a fire, and I
sat down to consider; but I soon began to feel very
hungry. What was to be done? I had nothing
to eat, when I suddenly bethought myself of my two
birds. But how to cook them? I adopted the old
poacher's plan of spitting them on the ramrod of my
rifle, and made Mahomed, the Massowah boy, roast
me some corn I had taken with me for my mule.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
With these victuals I made a tolerably fair lunch,
washed down with water&mdash;<i>fames optimum condimentum</i>,
as the Latin grammar says. It was getting
late in the day and I was becoming bored, so I
said to Brou, who had been loitering behind on the
road and had not long come up, "We had better go
to the village to forage, as perhaps there has been a
difficulty about getting our baggage carried on from
Koudoofellassie, and the things will not come up to-night."
He answered, "Very well." So we all started
to the village.</p>

<p>I went up to the old chicker's house and asked for
bread, or, in fact, anything that he had. His wife&mdash;who
was as big a liar as himself&mdash;told me that she
had nothing. So I went straight in and took a large
jug of beer and a jar of honey, gave them to my
servants to carry, and walked back towards our future
camping-place. The old lady now began to yell, and
the other women of the village joined in chorus. The
men in the village all turned out with spears, shields,
guns, sticks, etc., and surrounded us, making a horrid
noise. They managed to get the beer away from us,
but we stuck to the honey, and one of the servants
and myself brought it to the tree where I had been
sitting. The natives continued yelling, and Brou tried
to pacify them. Some of the young fellows said, "We
will die! we will die! but you shall not keep the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
honey"&mdash;Brou having told them I would shoot if
they tried to molest me. The noise went on, and I
thought it was likely to get serious, when suddenly
there was a lull, and a priest stepped out from the
crowd and requested a parley with me. I went up to
him, and he made me a bow and said something in
Amharic, which it is needless to say I did not understand.
The Abyssinians are Coptic Christians,
and I thought I would try him with a text from the
Bible; so I said, "I asked for bread, and they gave
me a stone." I never before saw a man's face change
so completely; Brou had interpreted the sentence
exactly. The priest then said, "You speak like a
king; these people are only dirt in comparison with
you," etc. Well, it all ended by my keeping the
honey, and the villagers returning to their houses.
We made up a good fire. Brou produced some bread,
which I ate with the honey; it was excellent&mdash;stolen
fruit is always the sweetest. I piled the arms near
the fire, rolled myself up in a <i>shama</i> of Brou's, and
lay down on a sheepskin to go to sleep. I had almost
dozed off when H. arrived with all the baggage.
The reason he was so late was that the men at
Koudoofellassie demanded exorbitant prices. We
have now twenty coolies and three donkeys to carry
into Adiaboo. K. made this arrangement: so we
shall have no more trouble for some little time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Borum Bras. brought with him a man chained to
one of his soldiers; this individual, who was, I believe,
a murderer, was going to the king to be tried.
The law in Abyssinia is the old Mosaic one&mdash;"an
eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."</p>

<p><i>Jan. 20.</i>&mdash;We started about half-past nine in the
morning, accompanied by Borum Bras., the chief, and
all his followers. He was to go with us as far as the
boundary of his province, and there leave us. He
rode a very fine mule, with his horse led in front of
him. The mule turned out to be a fencer; Borum Bras.
popping over a thorn hedge in very good form as we
went along. We stopped for a short rest at Adwahla,
a village, and Borum Bras. made his followers bring
us some beer, which is made from the Dargousa
grain. I thought it very nasty, but my servants
soon drank it all. I saw a rather curious phenomenon
here: there was a sudden rush of wind,
then in a moment we were enveloped in a cloud of
dust. It was one of those whirlwinds which very
often occur in the East, especially on broad plains.
There is not a breath of wind stirring, but, all of a
sudden, you see a little curl of dust coming towards
you; and it gets larger and larger as it proceeds. All
the dust of the village was carried up in a column
towards the skies. One of Borum Bras.'s servants, on
seeing this, immediately covered me up in the cotton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
cloth he was wearing; and I scarcely know which
was worse, the smell of the Abyssinian's garment or
that of the dust.</p>

<p>All the country we had been travelling through was
highly cultivated, and the ballagas were, as far as I
could see, breaking up fresh land every day for
sowing; in fact, I should say that the whole province
of Tigré was in a very prosperous condition. It is a
great pity such a country as this, which to all intents
and purposes is close to Europe, should not be made
use of in some way or other. Cotton would grow in
most parts with great luxuriance; it is grown in the
province of Walkait, and brought into the rest of
Abyssinia by large caravans, who exchange it for
grain, salt, etc. In the valleys among the hills I
believe all sorts of things would grow, and in a short
time I hope to send out seeds of all the English
vegetables, to make a trial of them at Gindar. There
is one plant which would return very high profits to
the growers, and that is <i>cinchona</i>, for quinine. Where
plenty of water is to be had I am sure this plant
would do well. Of course the great drawback to all
commerce in Abyssinia is the badness of the roads;
in fact, there are no roads, merely paths across the
table-lands, and as a rule among the hills the roads
follow the dry watercourses.</p>

<p>When Borum Bras. and his servants had had enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
beer we started again. He accompanied us to the
verge of this large table-land we had been going over,
and seemed very particular about the exact boundary
of his province and the spot where to leave us. We
got off our mules and said, "Good-bye," shaking
hands with him. He wished us a pleasant journey
and abundant sport; and so we parted with the most
civil Abyssinian I had yet met. The ground fell very
suddenly here, and we began to descend a rocky
road. If I could only make the reader appreciate the
beautiful scenery that now lay spread before us! but
I am afraid that words would convey but a poor idea
of its grandeur and beauty; so we must continue on
our road. Some parts of the descent were so steep
that I had to get off my mule and walk. We had
thoughtlessly omitted to bring cruppers for our saddles,
so we often found ourselves nearly astride of the mule's
head instead of his back; the only way to remedy
this was to get off and shift the saddle, which was
tiresome work. K. told me that this was a fearful
hill to ascend during the rains, the mules slipping
about and tumbling down. We got to our camping-place
about two hours before sunset&mdash;a pretty spot
with plenty of grass, and the water came from
deep pools close by. I took my gun and went
for a stroll but saw nothing, and I only heard an
old cock grouse calling. H. had gone in an opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
direction, but he too had seen nothing to provide
sport.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 21.</i>&mdash;This morning we had time to look about
us before starting; the township of Gundet lay
scattered over the little hills which rose out of this
valley. I resolved to go up to the village and
procure a goat and some bread. K. had provided us
with a document which was stamped with the king's
seal; this, when the Abyssinians saw it, had the
effect of making them give what was wanted. The
king seldom if ever gives his seal to any one; and the
seal itself, from which the impression is taken, is
carried about hung round the neck of one of his page
boys. I started with Goubasee and Brou for one of
the cluster of huts I saw on the top of the hill; the
servants said it was there the chief of the village
resided. The ascent was steep, but we caught the old
gentleman sitting outside his house basking in the
morning sun; no doubt he would have bolted if he
had had any intimation of our coming. We said,
"How d'ye do?" and then I showed him the king's
seal, and said we wanted a young fat goat, of which
there are large herds here. The cattle of Gundet are
also very fine. He said if we would come into his
house he would talk about it. Well-to-do Abyssinians
always have a large round hut set apart for the reception
of visitors. His son produced some "tej," which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
was very good, and turning round to his father just
before pouring it out he said laughingly, "I don't
know whether we ought to be drinking this tej, which
is made for my marriage feast." I asked him if his
future wife was pretty; he said, "Oh, yes, and she
has plenty of cattle." This is the usual dowry in
Abyssinia, especially among the ballagas; so my
readers will see that people in that country marry for
a fortune as much as ours do at home.</p>

<p>H. and K. now came up to the house. The fat
goat was brought and given to one of the servants to
drive before him; and we started for the Mareb, where
we were going to stay a little time to shoot. There was
a difficulty about finding our way, so we took a guide
from one of the villages as we passed. This man did
not seem to understand where we wanted to go to,
and took us to another village, rather out of our road.
Here we had a dispute, as a man from this village
refused to go with us as guide; we tied him by his
<i>shama</i> to our first guide, and sent them on in front
of our mules. All the women and some of the men
in the village remonstrated and made a great noise,
chattering and yelling to the top of their voices;
when I ran in among them and pushed them right
and left. This effectually stopped the noise, and we
continued our journey in peace, while K. was much
amused at my proceedings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>We passed by Aila Mareb, a village on the side of
the hill. This is the last village before entering the
desert, as the Abyssinians call all wild jungle; that
is to say, parts of the country that are not inhabited.
On the right of the path we were travelling along
rose a large hill, with a table-land at the top. The
peculiar shape of it struck me very much; as another
ridge rose on the table-land, it looked in the distance
like a vast breastwork. This hill overlooks a
large jungled plain through which the Mareb runs&mdash;celebrated
at one time as the abode of a noted
"shifter," or robber, who defied the king's troops for
some time and used to ravage the villages lying near
the plain. He was caught at last; and the king said
he would not kill him, as it was a pity to send him
out of the world without giving him time to repent.
So his eyes were put out with a hot iron, and he was
allowed to live among his family and friends. This
is a good instance of Abyssinian subtlety and cruelty.</p>

<p>Our road now lay through thick jungle, and in some
parts high grass. The hills soon ceased, and we found
ourselves in the valley of the Mareb. All of a sudden,
on emerging from the thick jungle, we came on a
fallow field; the crop had been reaped, and was
stacked close by. The ballagas living near the valley
of the Mareb very often sow crops after the rains, as
the soil by the side of the river is very fertile indeed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
This crop is watched by small boys of the village,
to protect it from birds, deer, elephants, etc., but in
many cases the best part of it is destroyed. The
crop, or rather crops&mdash;for sometimes they reap two or
three&mdash;are so heavy that it does not greatly matter if
a little is eaten. The dry bed of the Mareb was at
the bottom of this field, and thick, impenetrable jungle
rose up on all sides, so we agreed to camp in the
open field by the bank of the river.</p>

<p>I said the river was dry; by this I mean that the
water runs under the sand, and is got at by making
a hole, when it gradually filters through. The water
is excellent for drinking, and deliciously cool. I
ordered my servants to make a large hole in the
sand, and the water here I arranged should be
kept apart for our own drinking; no one was
either to wash in it or foul it in any way. It is
a very good plan when near a stream to make your
servants do all their washing, etc., down the stream,
so as to keep the water as pure as possible for your
own drinking. The time we spent on the Mareb I
shall always look back to with great pleasure. Our
little camp was very conveniently fixed. The jungle
here teemed with all sorts of most beautiful birds,
including partridges and guinea-fowl in abundance.
The little sandgrouse used to come in flocks every
evening to drink from the scattered pools along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
river-bed. The jungle also gave us most delicious
wild tomatos, and as it was the dry season it had
up to this time been almost impossible to procure any
green vegetables, except the <i>gram</i> before mentioned.
These tomatos were very acceptable, they were the
sweetest I ever ate, far better in flavour than our
own cultivated ones; we used to make excellent
salads with them, and also get them stewed. I
had felt the want of green vegetables very much,
and I am persuaded that, in a hot country, eating
largely of provisions preserved in tins is not at all
good.</p>

<p>The ballaga to whom the field belonged in which
we were camped said a lion used frequently to come
and bask in the sun and look at him while he was at
his work, not taking the smallest notice. There must
have been some of these animals about, as we used to
see fresh tracks almost every day; but, alas! not one
single one did we catch sight of the whole time; and
as all sportsmen know who have been in Africa, there
is no animal so hard to discover or get near when
seen. The lion is scarcely the noble beast which is
seen represented in pictures, or read of in nursery
books and fables; on the contrary, he feeds on
carrion when he can get it, and sneaks away at the
approach of man. The tiger in India is a much finer
animal. In the evening I went a few hundred yards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
out of camp down the river, and shot an old cock
guinea-fowl and a brace of small sandgrouse. These
latter were most lovely little birds, and Fisk preserved
one for H.'s collection.</p>

<span class="s08"><i>To face page 91.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Jan. 22.</i>&mdash;I find, according to my journal, that the
events of this day were most unlucky. I went up the
river with Goubasee and the elephant-hunter that Brou
had with him as a sort of servant. I only saw a deer
cross the dry bed of the river in front of me, but out
of shot. I had gone up some little way, and was
resting, sitting on some large granite rocks. The force
of the water during the rains must be tremendous, as
these rocks were scooped and hollowed out as if
by the hand of man. A large pool of water was just
below me; the hot weather had not yet dried it up,
and the basin of rock prevented it filtering away
through the sand. My rifle lay close by me, and
wishing to put it at half-cock, I touched the trigger
without taking it up. By mistake I fingered the
wrong one: it went off, and as nearly as possible shot
Goubasee, who was reclining close beside me. He took
it very well, and the elephant-hunter only laughed,
and made a movement as if digging in the sand with
his stick; meaning, if the ball had hit him it would
have been all up with poor Goubasee, and we should
have had to bury him. I got up very much disgusted
with myself, and walked over the rocks on the way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
back to camp, but on the way I slipped and fell,
denting both the barrels of my little 16-bore. "It
seldom rains but it pours:" these two accidents occurred
in the space of about five minutes. The gun was
rendered quite useless by this accident; so I returned
home dejected, and on the way I amused myself by
throwing a spear at a mark on a tree. The two
Abyssinians who were with me made very good
practice. It is extraordinary how hard it is to make
sure of hitting anything with this weapon, though
the mode of throwing it is simple enough. The
spear is held in the right hand, not over the head, but
about in a line with the shoulder; lightly balancing
it one takes three steps, starting with the left foot,
and delivers the spear as the right foot comes to the
ground. King Theodore was a celebrated spear
thrower; it is said he could make sure of a man at
thirty yards or more. On my way home I was
puzzling in my mind how to get the dented barrels of
my little gun straight again. I had some hardened
bullets with me for my rifle, which fitted this gun
exactly, and I thought if one of these bullets was
introduced into the barrel and gently and gradually
tapped with one of our wooden tent-mallets it might
straighten it. When I got to camp I told Fisk
what I thought of it; he said he would try, and
being a very handy fellow and understanding guns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
well, the experiment proved a complete success, and
the gun shot just as well as it did before. Of course
the dents were not completely obliterated, but sufficiently
for all practical purposes. I must not forget
to say the barrels had been injured about half-way
down from the muzzle.

</p>

<p><i>Jan. 23.</i>&mdash;I started very early this morning,
before sunrise&mdash;or with the "morning star," as the
Abyssinians say&mdash;and went down the river to see
what sport I could find. It was so cold that I rode
out of camp on my mule, wrapped up in an Ulster.
Directly the sun rose it got warm, but up to that
time the air was very piercing. After going down the
river some little way we came to a large field of
Dargousa corn: here I stopped, and leaving my
mule in care of one of the servants, determined to
walk over some of the hills on the right bank of the
river and see what I could find. Goubasee, my gun-bearer,
was very anxious to stop and warm himself at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
a fire which two of the ballagas had made in a sort of
hut, which was built to live in during the time that
the corn was ripening and that they were thrashing it
out. These natives slept in the hut, and guarded the
corn at night from the inroads of wild beasts. I told
Goubasee to come on and not lag behind&mdash;as after
it gets hot in this country one never sees any
game, for all retire to the thick jungle. I walked
up a steep hill, and soon came, at the top, on a
broad level plateau. Part of this plateau was cultivated;
the rest of it was short, dry grass, which
reached up to the knees. It looked a very likely
place for game, especially pigs or deer. I made
Goubasee and another man I had with me spread out
and walk through the grass, in the hopes of "putting
up" something; but we saw nothing there. Where
the grass ceased there was a rocky, stony piece of
ground, with short, stunted trees growing on it. All
of a sudden, by the side of one of these little trees, I
saw a fine old boar standing. He looked steadily at
me, and I looked at him&mdash;we were both very much
taken by surprise, as I almost came on the top of
him. The colour of this animal is so much like the
dried-up ground that it is very hard at first to discern.
H. had lent me his Express this morning, so I
fired and hit him behind the shoulder. He galloped
off, and was circling round towards me, when I gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
him the left barrel, which caught him just behind the
ear; he rolled over like a rabbit, and lay with his
legs kicking in the air. He turned out to be a wart-hog.
We skinned him and took off his head, which I
have kept. Goubasee, while the operation of skinning
was going on, cut off large lumps of the quivering
flesh and stuffed them into his mouth; he seemed
to enjoy it very much. Nearly all Abyssinians eat
<i>brundo</i>, which is their name for raw meat, and in
consequence of this they are all affected with <i>tænia</i>, or
tapeworm, and have periodically (I believe once a
month) to take a very strong purgative medicine,
which they call <i>coussou</i>. This destroys the worm for
a time, but it always reappears again. By reason of
this, nearly all Abyssinian men are very hollow-cheeked,
and some of them exceedingly thin; but,
notwithstanding this, their powers of marching long
distances over their hills with very little food is
something marvellous.</p>

<p>When we had skinned the wart-hog and taken
away what we wanted for food, we hung up the
carcase in a tree. Before going any farther I wish to
recommend all sportsmen who go out to wild countries
to learn a little butchering before leaving home; it is
most useful not only to know how to cut up a beast,
but also to know the different parts of the animal,
their names, and what to reject and what to keep for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
food, and how to remove the parts from the carcase.
Almost any afternoon at the slaughtering-houses of
the live meat market near the Great Northern Railway,
London, the butchers may be seen killing,
skinning, and dressing for the dead meat market,
both mutton and beef, and for a small gratuity they
are very ready to give any information.</p>

<p>I sent home one of the servants with the skin and
the head, and went on to look for more game with
Goubasee. I saw in the distance a rather curiously-forked
stick, as I thought; it was just over the top of
the grass. I never suspected for an instant that this
was an animal, so did not attempt to stalk in any
way, but walked straight on. To my great surprise,
however, I saw a beautiful, light red-coloured deer
lying just at the edge of the dry grass near an open
space. Of course when the animal saw me it jumped
up and bounded away at full speed; I took a snap
shot&mdash;and missed. This is a good instance of how
difficult it is when one first goes into a strange
country to distinguish game, for it is some little time
before the eye gets accustomed to the strange scenery,
and the ear to the unfamiliar noises and sounds that
are heard in a wild jungle. The forked stick, as
I thought it, was the two little pointed ears of
the deer. I now walked round this small plateau,
and determined to make for my mule and go home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
to breakfast, as it was getting hot. H. as well
had been out in the morning, and had seen a
large herd of Hagazin or koodoo, but could not get
near them. There was a very beautiful bird to be
seen in this jungle near the Mareb, in shape like an
English cuckoo, but of a very lovely light blue; as
most of my readers will know the tint of Eton blue,
it was almost exactly that colour. We shot several
specimens, which Fisk preserved. I had seen, the
evening before, a pair of wild geese in a pool down
the river, so I went out to try and get a shot at them.
I told K. that I was going to shoot them both at
one shot if I could; he said, "They are a great
deal too shy, you won't get near them." I went
down the river, when, lo, I saw my two friends
swimming about in a small pool. I fired at them with
my 16-bore No. 1 shot, killing the gander outright.
The goose flapped on a little way, and I thought I
had not got her, when Goubasee, who was with me,
rushed off down the river, having heard a faint cackle
in the distance, and came back with the goose in his
hand. It was very lucky that the bird made any
sound at all, as it was nearly pitch dark. I came back
to camp triumphantly with my two geese, and the
next evening we had them roasted and stuffed with
onions&mdash;they were excellent, and were among the
few things in Abyssinia that I had tasted really good.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jan. 24.</i>&mdash;I started very early indeed this morning&mdash;in
fact, by moonlight&mdash;in order to get on the
ground where I thought I should find game, before the
heat arose. The day before, I had seen a conically-shaped
mountain lying north of where I had been
shooting. Instead of leaving my mule in the cultivated
ground near the river, I turned up a path on
the right bank of the river, and rode some little way
into the hills. I left my mule on a little eminence
just below the edge of the table-land which I had shot
over the day before, and walked on towards the
mountain. I saw nothing but tracks of deer till I got
nearly to the top, and it was a very steep climb
indeed. On a little open space just below the summit
of the mountain I saw some jungle fowl pecking;
they were not in the least like the Indian jungle fowl
but brown-looking birds; in fact, they had the same
colour throughout, and exactly the shape of little
bantam hens. Unluckily, I had not my shot gun with
me, as I would have given much to have shot one of
these little creatures; but they ran away into the
jungle in a long file, and I did not see them again. I
now made for the summit of the mountain. There
was a small, thickly-wooded hollow just below where
I was climbing, and I thought very likely there might
be something lying in it, so I picked up a stone and
rolled it down, when out leaped two of those mouse-brown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
deer that I had seen at Sellaadarou; they
rushed away through the jungle, and I could only get
a snap shot at them, but managed to hit one of them.
I then climbed to the top of the mountain, on my
way towards which, I had heard a great number of
baboons chattering among the rocks, but when they
saw me they all scampered away.</p>

<p>At the top, to my great astonishment, I found a
small level plateau and the ruins of a village; the
circular walls of the huts were still standing, and
broken pottery was lying about in all directions.
This, most likely, was one of the villages that the
robber of the Mareb devastated, of whom I have
spoken before. What struck me most was how and
where the villagers got their water, as the country
round here was particularly dry; they must have
gone to the Mareb for it, which was at some distance.
I searched all about the mountain in hopes
of finding a spring, as I was very thirsty myself, but
there was no such thing to be seen. I was a little
tired with the climbing, so, getting under the shade of
one of the ruined walls, I curled myself up and went
to sleep for nearly an hour, Goubasee squatting close
by, watching me like a dog. When I awoke the
sun was high, so I thought I had better go home to
breakfast, and went down the opposite side of the
mountain to that I had come up. I saw my mule
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
like a speck in the distance, and made straight across
country for it, much to the chagrin of my gun-bearer,
who wished to go by a path which lay rather out of
the straight line. It was a heavy walk, as the jungle
was very thick; in fact, in one patch of thorns I
found myself completely suspended. My face and
hands were torn, but at length I reached my mule,
feeling very fatigued, as the walk had been a long
one. When back in camp I arranged that K., together
with Cassa, one of our head servants who
had charge of our transport arrangements, should
go on to Adiaboo with our heavy baggage, and
that we should change our camp some little way
down the river in order to shoot over fresh ground.
I went out of camp in the evening, and a little
way down the river I heard a great rush in the
jungle on the bank. My gun-bearer said it was a
lion, when I sat down and waited for some little time,
but I could hear no sound, nor could I see anything,
so I went home to dinner.</p>

<p>K. and I after dinner, over the camp-fire, were
talking of the Abyssinians and their religion. He
said that their version of the "fall of man" was
rather curious. It was this: Adam and Eve, who
lived in a beautiful garden, were happy and contented,
till one day the serpent came and said to Eve,
"Where is Adam?" She answered, "He is in another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
part of the garden." So the serpent sneeringly said,
"Oh, indeed, do you think so?" Eve rejoined, "For
what reason do you sneer?" The serpent replied,
"You think yourself the only woman in the world?"
and she said, "Yes, and a most beautiful woman."
The serpent then said, "Adam often stays away from
you, does he not, now? I will show you another
woman;" on which he produced a looking-glass. Eve
saw her image reflected in it and immediately became
jealous. The serpent then said, "If you wish to
secure Adam's love for ever and ever, you must eat of
the fruit which I will point out to you." So came
about the fall of man, according to Abyssinians.
This is quite consistent with Abyssinian character
and ideas, as probably no people are more vain
or conceited than they; jealousy in all things is
one of their chief failings. Abyssinians, in their
religion, are great bigots, and the whole country is
very much at the present time under the influence of
the priests. The king himself is very particular about
his religious observances, and priests and monasteries
are very often richly endowed. The Abyssinians'
hatred of the Mussulman is extreme. They have
always looked upon the Egyptians with great abhorrence
as well as terror, for already part of their
country called Bogos has been annexed by them.
They think that the Mussulman will try and overrun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the whole of Abyssinia, and, according to events that
are now taking place, this does not seem at all
improbable.</p>

<p>An Abyssinian is thought a great deal of if he
goes to Jerusalem, and they always think that the
Turk is going to destroy the holy places and sweep
away the relics that are kept there.</p>

<p>It may not be known to some of my readers that
the Queen of Sheba is supposed to have ruled over
Abyssinia, and at that time the country was evidently
a great deal more prosperous and civilised
than it is now. Elephants are said to have been used
as beasts of burden; nowadays, the natives have not
the smallest idea of taming this most useful animal.
There exist large ruins of palaces both at Goujam and
at Gindar, which testify to the wealth and magnificence
the country originally boasted of. It seems to
me a great pity that a country which is comparatively
so near Europe, and with a good seaboard, should be
so completely lost to the world. What few Abyssinian
chiefs I saw always impressed upon me that we, the
English, ought to come and live in the country. They
had formed, I am sure, a great opinion of England's
wealth and power from what they saw and also heard
of the Abyssinian expedition. I was told at Massowah
that an enormous quantity of material of different
sorts, that had been left behind after the war, quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
made the fortune of a tribe that lived on the coast;
for they sold all these materials at Massowah to the
Egyptian government. It forcibly struck me, while
travelling over these fertile lands, what an extensive
field there is for British industry and enterprise.
Abyssinia contains considerable mineral wealth; but
whether it is sufficiently localised to make its working
remunerative remains to be discovered. I tried to
get some information on this point from the French
bishop of Keren, who came down to Massowah with
us, and he told me he thought that minerals were not
to be profitably worked with the present means of
transport. K. often assured me that he had seen
unmistakable evidences of gold. If once there was a
gold rush to this country, it would certainly open it
up in a way; but the experience of other countries
makes one doubt whether such would prove a desirable
commencement to civilisation.</p>

<p>Very often on riding into the village I was greeted
by the Mussulman salutation of "<i>Salaam</i>," and they
always asked my servants if I was a Mussulman. It
was explained to them I was really a Christian, at
which they were much astonished. All the priests in
Abyssinia that I happened to meet I found to be very
sensible fellows; in fact, they are the only educated
members of the community. They dislike European
missionaries for the reason that the missionaries educate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the people, which education the priests endeavour to
check as much as possible. There is a country much
nearer home than Abyssinia which was, up to a short
time since, much in the same state; in fact, that
expression of "priest-ridden country" may be applied
to Abyssinia with as much force as it used to be
applied to the Sister Isle.</p>

<p>Before I go farther, I must mention that at this
camp we killed a cow for the benefit of our coolies
and servants, who ate it raw. K. had done this
while we were out of camp, so I did not see the
squabble which ensued. The bits were shared out
equally, but one of the men complained, said his
quantity was short, and he threw it at the man's head
who was dividing the portions. Then a general row
ensued, and they might be seen running about the
camp tearing lumps of raw flesh out of each other's
hands and cramming them into their mouths to get
rid of them as quickly as possible, much in the same
way as a pack of hounds would break up a fox.
When an Abyssinian sees or scents raw flesh he
becomes a perfectly wild savage; and the women eat
<i>brundo</i> as well as the men.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 25.</i>&mdash;In the afternoon, H. and I started down
the Mareb, intending to go a short way and then
pitch our camp. We followed the bank of the river,
but it was very deep walking, as the damp sand gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
way under the mules. I very nearly got bogged, only
just slipping off my mule in time, and directly the
weight was off his back he recovered himself. The
banks of the river, on both sides, were fringed with
tamarisk bushes, which form a thick cover, a favourite
one in India for tigers. We fixed our camp at the
place where the Zareena joins the Mareb; at this time
of the year&mdash;that is to say, the hot weather&mdash;the
Zareena is a beautiful running stream, and the water,
the servants told us, was considered excellent. We
pitched our tent on the shingly bed of the Mareb, and
I amused myself, with the help of my gun-bearers, by
getting firewood for the night, as Fisk and the luggage
had not come up yet. On the way here we passed
some Abyssinians sitting in a small bower, made of
branches, which was constructed over a water pool.
They had come down from the villages to hunt&mdash;that
is to say, to squat over the pool watching in turns,
night and day, for any animal that might chance to
come and drink. I do not think they killed much
game, and they seemed to spend most of their time
smoking a pipe, a rude sort of hookah, with a cocoanut
as the receptacle for the water that the smoke
passed through.</p>

<p>This evening I assembled our servants and coolies
and induced them to give us a dance and song in
their own fashion, I accompanying them on my banjo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
which I had brought with me. The dancing was rather
curious: all stood round in a circle singing a monotonous
chant and clapping their hands; one stood out
in the circle and went through extraordinary contortions,
throwing his body backwards as far as possible
and then twisting quickly round. In one part of the
dance they all squatted down and wriggled their
bodies about, making a sort of hissing noise with their
teeth. I requested Brou to translate the words of the
song, which were, "Plough, ploughman, plough, nor turn
your attention to merchandise;" this meant, of course,
stay at home, till your land, and lead a quiet life; do
not seek other riches in far countries. It was repeated
over and over again, like most Eastern songs; and
they would have gone on all night, I believe, if we
had allowed them.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 26.</i>&mdash;I went out in the morning at daybreak
and saw literally nothing but a dik-dik. There
are vast quantities of partridges amongst the tamarisk
bushes, which Fisk shoots for the pot with great
success. I always regret not having brought out a dog
of some sort or other, as dogs are always useful for
retrieving birds. I frequently came across the tracks
of koodoo, but never saw one. H. told me, when
he came back to camp, that he had "rolled over" a
deer, and, on running up to secure him, the animal
staggered away amongst the high grass and jungle and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
was lost. This was very bad luck, as it was the first
deer he had hit. I went down the river in the evening,
a very beautiful walk; the Mareb wound in some
places among rocks, in others through thick jungle. I
stopped to rest for a short time; a little gazelle ran out
and crossed the river bed a little way off. I shot with
my muzzle-loading rifle, and missed. This was another
chance gone for the Express. I found when I got
back to camp that some natives had been in; in fact,
they were the sportsmen whom we saw in their hut
beside the pool. They told us that a lion, a month ago,
had killed a man and eight cows, but this was not of
much use to us now. Why is it in all sport, whether
hunting, shooting, or fishing, you hear that you ought
to have been there the other day, or else it is too early&mdash;you
ought to have come later; the ground is very
hard, or the scent bad; the birds are still wild; or
else, when you go fishing, the water is thick, or the
fish are not on the feed, etc., etc.?</p>

<p><i>Jan. 27.</i>&mdash;I went out this morning with two of the
native hunters who had come into camp the day before.
We wandered over the hills, but I did not succeed in
shooting anything, and only saw two gazelles scouring
away in the distance. On the table-land, where I found
these gazelles, there was a very singular cavity in
the rocks, just on the edge of a cliff; it was almost as
if it had been hollowed out by the hand of man; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
was oblong-shaped, and it could easily have held two
or three hundred people. The day was very hot, and
the sun beat down on the dry rocks, so I made the
best of my way down the steep side of the hill into
the bed of the Mareb, which ran underneath. On the
way home I fired at a white eagle with my rifle, and
picked him off the top of the tree he was perched on,
but the bullet had so injured the bird that he was not
worth preserving. This was really a bad morning's
sport. H. had done no better than myself; and it
was a good deal owing to this that we determined to
move off the next day. This afternoon I presented
the hunters, who had been out with me, with three
common cotton pocket-handkerchiefs, of which I had
bought a good many at Bologna, in Italy, on my way
out. They seemed to be delighted with them, and
grinned and laughed, and passed them round for each
other to admire.</p>

<p>After luncheon, H. and I determined to ride down
the Mareb and explore that line of country. We
had not gone very far before we saw our friends
the hunters sitting round a small pool of water,
then tying the handkerchiefs round their heads and
admiring themselves, using the water as a looking-glass.
They looked very ridiculous, and seemed highly
delighted with their personal appearance, which they
evidently felt was greatly improved by the red cotton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
handkerchiefs. We rode a good way down the river,
and the farther we went the fewer the little pools of
water became: at last there was no water to be seen,
the sand had gradually absorbed it; and we should
have to dig four or five feet in order to get water here,
so it would be of very little use to go down into the
jungle by this route. H. and I amused ourselves
by setting fire to the jungle, in hopes of starting
some animal, but we saw nothing and so turned our
mules' heads towards home. It is interesting in
this country to see, while jungle is burning; this it
is always doing during the dry weather&mdash;the number
of birds&mdash;insect-catchers&mdash;hovering over the flames
and catching any flies, beetles, or butterflies, that
happen to be driven out of the grass and bushes by
the smoke and heat.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 28.</i>&mdash;To-day we started at 8.30 for Adiaboo.
We went up the bed of the Zareena for a short way
and then turned off sharp to the right; this will be
better understood by my readers when I say that,
after turning to the right, we began travelling very
nearly due west. The road was merely a jungle
path, and the bushes were in some places very thick,
which scratched our knees as we pushed through
them. Sometimes we rode up the dry bed of a
watercourse, at other times we struck right into the
thorny forest of mimosa bushes. At last we came to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
a more civilised part of the country, and halted in
the bed of a small river called Maitumloo, where
at some deep pools the cattle were being watered by
the boys of the village, who were minding them.
Here we stopped for about half an hour, watering our
mules and resting ourselves; we then made for the
village of Zadawalka. We did not actually go straight
up to the village, but camped in the usual camping-place
for travellers who go by this route, that is to
say, close to the water, of which there was a large
pool here. We pitched our tent on a little ledge just
over the pool, where there was barely room for the
tent and the camp fire. We had got in early this
afternoon, having come along at a pretty good pace;
Petros and Hadji Mahomet had happened to lose
their way in the jungle, and did not come at all that
evening.</p>

<p>Our coolies that we had brought from Koudoofellassie,
had, as is usual with most blacks when
they travel, brought very little food with them, for
when natives go a journey it is usually a succession
of forced marches, which they manage to do with
wonderfully little nourishment. They were all seated
at the pool, having washed off the dust of the journey,
talking and chattering, when there appeared in
sight some villagers, who Brou, the interpreter, told
me were returning from a funeral feast. Of course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the coolies understood very well the state of affairs.
The natives at feasts in this country not only eat as
much as they can, but also contrive to take away
with them what they cannot manage to cram down
their throats; so here was a prospect of a good meal
for our coolies. A rush was made at a batch of
small boys and men who were returning, their clothes
were almost torn off their backs, and the bread and
"tef" which they had concealed about their persons
were seized and devoured by our hungry men. This
was the first batch of visitors, and our men were in
anticipation of more coming. At last some more
appeared, this time bearing a large earthenware jar,
which was thought to contain beer, but, alas! it
was empty. There were other natives that our
men thought had some bread with them, and they
accordingly hustled them, but found none. During
the struggle, a coolie was pushed backwards into
the muddy pool, and was rather astonished to find
himself seated in the water, much to the amusement
of ourselves and all the servants but himself:
he sneaked back and sat down by the fire to dry
the few rags he had on him as best he could. Three
or four more villagers came by, among them two
young Abyssinians, who said, "You have been robbing
our people&mdash;you will see what we will do to you
to-morrow!" I think they were a little the worse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
for the "tej" and beer they had been drinking, as
they boasted and were very impudent. At last they
got a little too "cheeky," saying, "You are a Rass"
(which means a lord, in Abyssinia), "and ought to
know better than let your servants do this." This
rather annoyed me, so I jumped across the stream,
snatched one of the sticks out of their hands, and gave
them two or three cuts across the back, as hard as I
could, and told the interpreter to tell them that was
the way a Rass was accustomed to treat people
who were impudent; so they went away rather
frightened, amid the jeers of the servants and coolies.</p>

<p>My readers may think this was rather a summary
proceeding, especially as our servants had been
robbing the people of their bread; but it is a thing
always taken for granted, as people are supposed
to be hungry when they are travelling, and those
that were robbed took it as a very good joke,
and laughed and chaffed, especially when they were
searched and found to have no victuals of any
description concealed on their persons. My grey
mule, which K. gave me at Gindar, had a sore back,
and I was afraid he would only just be able to take
me into Adiaboo, where I should have to give him up
and get another.

</p>

<p><i>Jan. 29.</i>&mdash;To-day we made a very long march, in
fact, the longest we had made since we had been in
the country. We started at 7 o'clock in the morning,
leaving the village of Zadawalka on our right, and
we struck across the table-land in front of us, which
was intersected by a large ravine. The scenery on
the table-land was lovely, and the streams became
more frequent. Towards the middle of the day we
reached a very extensive plain; in the distance might
be seen the high-peaked hill which marks Adiaboo.
It is just below this, and in the shade of a large tree,
that the market of Adiaboo is held every Saturday.
The principal village on the plain was one called
Sememmar. We got off our mules and went to forage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
among the houses for some honey; and the natives
sold us a large gumbo, or jar, full of honey, for a
dollar. They were very civil, but, as usual, our
servants amused themselves by purloining as many
little things and eatables as they could lay their
hands on. We agreed to camp by a stream which
was a little way on, and where the table-land ended,
called Maihumloo. The descent down into the
little valley, or ravine, was very pretty, and when
we got down to the bottom the country was almost
like a pleasure-ground, rills of trickling water ran
across our path, and various shrubs bearing sweet-smelling
flowers grew in every direction; it only
wanted neat gravel walks to make it the most perfect
of gardens. We fixed our camp by the side of the
stream. Any future traveller would know the spot
very well, as a white-faced rock rises up from the
stream, with bushes growing over it.</p>

<p>An old lady in the village had asked me if I
should like to buy some Dargousa spirit; I told
her if she liked to bring it down to our camp that I
would purchase it. Accordingly she followed us
down and produced two bottles of this native spirit,
which I thought would be a good thing to give to our
coolies, as they had had an exceedingly long march
and were completely done up, and when we halted
they most of them lay down unable to move. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of them was utterly exhausted, and said he was dying.
I imagined it would be a good idea to serve them
all with honey, of which they are very fond, and
accordingly I made them come forward, and gave
them each a large handful of honey. Directly the
dying coolie heard that this honey was being given he
appeared to get wonderfully better, and jumped up
and came for his share. He had given a good deal
of trouble on the march and always lagged behind,
calling on the other coolies to carry his load; so I
said he was not to have any, and I did not give him
any. These natives have to be treated like children
in every respect. I had arrived at the place where
I fixed the camp a little before H., and, hearing
some wild geese cackling up the stream, I took my
gun and went to try to bag one of them for dinner.
I fired at them and missed. Not many seconds after
firing H. appeared from behind some bushes, and
we discovered we had both been stalking the same
geese. It is very lucky I did not pepper him. He
seemed a little annoyed; but this sort of thing very
often occurs when two fellows are shooting together
in a wild country. I went out by myself afterwards
to try and get some partridges, as I heard a few
calling to each other near camp. I managed to kill a
brace, and they proved very acceptable food after our
long and tedious march.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>Half-way on our journey here we came to the
market-place of Sememmar; the market is held in a
sort of hollow dell by the side of the path that we
travelled along. It was a very picturesque sight
looking down on the market, the people seated round
the sides of a hill like an amphitheatre. Of course
we got down to inspect the wares offered for sale:
beads, needles, buttons, were among the articles, as
well as antimony for blacking the eyebrows and eyelashes
of Abyssinian ladies. There was also a good
deal of cotton and grain for sale. The only thing I
purchased was a native sword, which cost a dollar,
and which I handed over to Goubasee, my gun-bearer,
to carry for me. This sword was made, like some of
the Indian tulwars, of very soft iron, but sharpened
like a razor. Its shape was well adapted for cutting,
slightly curved, and the back of the broad blade was
heavy and thick. The worst part of an Abyssinian
sword is its handle, which is made of wood, with no
guard whatsoever. Generally, when a native goes into
battle, he ties the handle of his sword round his wrist
with a piece of rag or handkerchief. There is also
another description of sword which they carry. This
is a much lighter one, and very much curved, even
more so than a Turkish scimitar. I had no opportunity
of seeing a native use the sword. What they
seemed to excel in most was throwing the spear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jan. 30.</i>&mdash;This morning we did not start till much
later, as the whole of the party were rather knocked
up by the march of the day before. The country was
very lovely that we travelled through. The path rose
until we found ourselves on a very extensive plain: as
we travelled over it, one of my gun-bearers pointed
out a place, south of the route we pursued, where the
king of Abyssinia had had a great battle with the
Gallas, on which occasion three hundred of the Galla
horsemen rode over a sheer precipice, nearly every one
of them being killed. I trotted on across the plain
towards Adiaboo, and the large peaked hill appeared
nearer and nearer. I forgot to say that, before we
started this morning, I managed to bag one of the wild
geese which we had seen, and stalked unsuccessfully,
the night before. These birds are most excellent
eating, and they and the partridges are nearly the best
food in the shape of game that is found in Abyssinia,
but the guinea-fowl are nearly always tough.</p>

<p class="caption">OUR CAMP AT MASSOWAH.<br />
<span class="s08"><i>To face page 118.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>It was market-day at Adiaboo, a much larger affair
than at Sememmar the day before, and a considerable
gathering of people were here, all chattering and
making a great noise, it being the busiest time. I
asked some of the bystanders where K. was, and
where our camp was pitched. They pointed a little
farther on, and I soon saw K.'s tent and a "das" built
close by. A das is a sort of bower made of boughs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
which Abyssinian servants in a very short time put
up. It is made of four tall forked poles; over these
are laid boughs which are again interlaced with other
boughs. It makes a delightfully cool shade for the
middle of the day, and we always used to live in
one when we were in camp during the day, but of
course we slept in our tent at night. A "das" was
very necessary here, as there was no shade to be found
for some distance round. K. was very pleased to see
us. He had come a shorter route, and his party had
almost lost their way and been very hard pressed for
water. He said he had been very ill on the journey,
and scarcely able to ride his mule. The black sheep
that, my readers will remember, we had made a pet
of was completely worn out, and was carried, the
greater part of the journey, by one of the servants.</p>

<p>K. had told me that Rass Barea, the chief of
Tigré, had written to the chief of Adiaboo to say that
hunters were to be placed at our disposal, and that
men were to accompany us down into the country
where elephants and other large game were to be
found. Adik, the chief of Adiaboo, was in camp ready
to pay his compliments and to ask us what we wanted.
He and his followers all sat on the ground a short
way off, with their shamas thrown across their shoulders
and covering their mouths; this is always considered,
in Abyssinia, a most dignified position. Here we found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
letters from home waiting for us, which of course we
were very pleased to get. Any scrap of news from
his own country and friends, to a traveller quite out
of the march of civilisation, is a great luxury. H.
had not come in when I arrived, as I had gone on
rather fast in front of him: there were also letters for
him, so I took them and walked a little way out of the
camp to meet him with them, and never saw anybody
so delighted; in fact, we were both in the best
of spirits. After I had read the letters, I asked K.
to come round the market of Adiaboo with me to see
the people, and also to look if there was anything
worth buying.</p>

<p>The large tree, mentioned before, was the centre of
attraction, and those who brought horses with them
had them tied up under the shade of the tree. The
tree was hung all round with shields, some for sale
and others belonging to the owners of the horses; as
every Abyssinian, whenever he goes even the shortest
way from home, always takes with him his shield and
his spear&mdash;just in the same way as an Irishman carries
his stick. I bought two shields for five dollars; one I
gave to Goubasee, my gun-bearer, and the other to
Guyndem, my second gun-bearer: they both seemed
mightily pleased and proud, and said they would take
the greatest care of them. The shields were made of
the skin of a species of large deer; they were thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
and tough. The old merchant from whom I bought
them was a very communicative person; he had a
large silver ring on his finger which I admired; he
very kindly took it off, and said he would give it to
me. I, of course, said no; but, as he still pressed, I
said, well, I would pay him a little more for the shields&mdash;which
arrangement he seemed to agree to. The rest
of the day we spent in reading our letters and discussing
the contents of all of them, and also in writing
others in return, as there would be no chance of
sending messengers to the post after we left Adiaboo.</p>

<p>A man named John&mdash;at least that was the name he
went by&mdash;had come into our camp from Adowa; he
was said to be the son of an Englishman who had been
in the country some time before. He stood about six
feet two, and would have been rather good-looking
but that he was marked with small-pox. He brought
a very welcome present to us, and that was some potatoes.
These vegetables are only grown near Adowa,
as it is only within a few years that they have been
introduced into the country, to which they were
brought by a Frenchman, whose name, we hope, will
be as immortal as that of Sir Walter Raleigh. The
potatoes were very small, in fact, wretched-looking
things, but were excellent eating; and we were very
glad to get them, as we had been excessively hard up
for vegetables; in fact, we had had scarcely any since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
leaving Gindar. John said he would go down into
the jungle with us. The only words of English he
knew were, "How do you do?" and "Good morning,"
which he uttered whenever one addressed him. His
trade was that of a silversmith, in Adowa, which I am
told is a very lucrative one, as dollars are given to
make into silver ornaments, such as the decorations
of a shield, etc., and then as the dollars, which are
already of rather base metal, are mixed with a good
amount of tin, by the time the ornaments are made
there is not much original metal left in them. Mansfield
Parkyns, in his very entertaining book on Abyssinia,
gives an account of the silversmiths at Adowa.
One of the young chiefs at Adiaboo, a relation of Adik
the old chief, also said he would go down into the
jungle with us and help us to hunt. This young man
was about eighteen or nineteen, and was accompanied
by a sort of bear-leader, a much older Abyssinian,
who, in fact, had been his tutor all his life&mdash;a man
named Barrakee. This old fellow was chief of a small
village on the frontiers of Abyssinia, and close to
the Baria tribe. Some part of the Baria country
is supposed to belong to Abyssinia; and Barrakee
told us that he actually received tribute of wild
honey and other small things from the Baria. This
man played a very important part during the rest of
our journey; and, when the young chief left us while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
we were on the Tackazzee, he chose to stay behind
to help in the hunting and to guide us through this
part of the country, which he knew very well.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 31.</i>&mdash;To-day we killed a young cow in camp,
and also paid our coolies who had come from Koudoofellassie.
The coolies, after they had been paid, could
not agree upon the division of some extra money
that had been given them&mdash;in fact, the man who gave
the most trouble about it was my old friend who had
shammed ill while travelling up to our last camp.
They all came to me to settle the dispute; and, after
one party had arranged themselves on one side, and
the other party on the other&mdash;the latter consisting of
only one&mdash;I heard the cause of dispute. It was very
clear that the coolie who had shammed ill wanted to
get the best of his friends; so, as most of the rest were
against him, I said, "Two heads are better than one&mdash;and
you must give up your claim." The men in
whose favour the decision had been given went away
shouting, laughing, and dancing about; the beaten
party retired rather crestfallen. I asked if any of
them would volunteer to come down into the jungle
with us. There was one young fellow among them
who had always been first on the march, and when in
camp always singing and laughing. I particularly
wanted to get him as a servant; but he said he had
a wife and family and could not manage to come.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
After a deal of persuasion I got one of them to stay,
a man named Philookus. I think most of them
thought that they had had enough of marching, and,
if the marches in future were to be anything like the
two former ones, they were quite right in turning back.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake, during travelling in rough
countries, to force your marches; it not only tires
yourself and harasses your coolies, but also wears out
your beasts of burden, a most important consideration.
The Italian proverb, <i>Che va piano va sano</i>, is
daily exemplified when you are away from civilisation
and railways. The best method is to start early in
the morning, make a short march, and then rest
during the heat of the day. After everybody and all
the beasts are well rested start again, and get into
camp in good time before the sun goes down, so as to
get everything comfortable and snug for the night.
By the bye, one is very much struck, on first arriving
in the East, by the astonishment with which the
natives receive an Englishman's protestations that he
is in a hurry&mdash;that he must go on at once. I believe
Arabs have a saying, in the spirit of which they certainly
act, that "haste is devilish."</p>

<p>A number of little sand-grouse, early in the morning,
had come circling round the tent and settling on some
ploughed ground close to us; I went out and killed a
brace and a half. These little birds are very good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
eating, one part of their flesh being white and
the other brown. We agreed to-day that here at
Adiaboo we should buy donkeys to carry our things
down to the Tackazzee, so we told the chief to get
us as many as he could. He said that to-morrow
he would tell the people round to bring in what
donkeys they had for sale. I went out in the evening
into the marshy ground which lay below our camp, to
try to get some snipe; I only saw one, but he was too
far off for a shot. We had a very good dinner to-night,
for we had killed fresh meat, which we were
very glad to get, as the two days that we had been
travelling we had had very little with us, although
K. had made every preparation for us, and boiled
down some excellent jelly, which he had corked up
in a few empty gin-bottles and carefully placed in
H.'s tin-case among his clothes; but, whether it
was the heat or the shaking that the tin-case got on
the journey I do not know: when we opened it, in
order to take some jelly for soup, we found that the
corks had flown out of the bottles, and a sort of
mayonnaise had been made of H.'s socks, boots, and
trousers. Such are the pleasures of rough travelling!</p>

<p><i>Feb. 1.</i>&mdash;To-day we began buying donkeys, and a
more disagreeable task I had never had to do; such
haggling and bargaining as had to be undergone was
enough to drive one mad. They brought up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
donkeys sometimes singly and sometimes in pairs;
we had on an average to pay six dollars a-piece for
them, which was a great deal too much. This included
the pads on which the package was strapped,
and also the "mechanias," or leather thongs which
strap the baggage on. The only thing to be assured of
in buying donkeys is that they are not suffering from
recent sores on their backs; and a very good way of
testing their strength is to put both hands in the
small of their back and to press down with all your
weight: a good donkey's back will yield very little,
but a bad one cannot bear it at all. Cassa, the man
who had charge of our transport arrangements, helped
me greatly in buying the donkeys. The very minute
I bought one and paid for it I marked it by clipping
a square patch on its rump with a pair of nail scissors:
this was quite enough for all present purposes. The
great difficulty was to make the natives bring the
pads and straps, as without them of course the
donkeys were perfectly useless. We here employed
some servants in making sandals for themselves out
of cow-skin that I had bought at Deevaroua; in fact,
most of them asked me to allow them to make some,
as the paths through the jungle are very thorny and
stony, and not like travelling through the cultivated
fields of Tigré. Plowden Gubrihote, H.'s gun-bearer,
was shoe&mdash;or rather sandal&mdash;maker to the rest; he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
been, when a little boy, servant to Consul Plowden, who
was murdered in South Abyssinia, and he was a
capital servant, but rather cowardly.</p>

<p>In the evening Barrakee, the young chief's tutor,
proposed that we should go up to the top of a
high-peaked hill close by, and see the country we
were approaching. We rode up some distance, and at
last had to get off our mules as the way became very
steep. Certainly a more glorious view I never saw.
To the north-west we could see the plains through
which the Mareb runs, and to the south-west were the
mountains among whose gorges that splendid river
the Tackazzee flows; beyond the Tackazzee to the
west, in fact in front of us, might be seen two
mountains, one of which is of a very peculiar shape&mdash;these
mark the province of Walkait. On the
top of one of these mountains is a fort or stronghold
which cannot be reached except by ropes&mdash;no human
being can climb up to it. Due south of where we
were standing lay crowded together that mass of
mountains called the Siemien range, the tops of
which, the natives informed us, were covered with
snow the whole year round. This I cannot vouch for,
as I certainly did not see any at that time; and I
almost think, if there had been snow, it would have
caught the rays of the setting sun, and it could have
been seen quite distinctly. The Tackazzee rises in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the Siemien from springs; at least, this I think and
believe is the case, on the authority of an old servant
we had with us, called Hadji Mahomet, who came
from that part of the world. As we looked below us
we could see the inmates of some huts that were
clustered round the mountain engaged in celebrating
a marriage. All the company were assembled in a
large "das," or leafy bower, drinking and dancing,
and every now and then a shot would be fired off in
the air in celebration of the auspicious event. As I
looked towards the distant view which lay before us I
little thought that on my return journey I should be
as anxious to get home as I was then to explore those
regions. We waited till the sun set behind the mountains
of Walkait, and then came down the hill and
made for camp.</p>

<p>H. and I very much wished, before leaving the
country, to try and get some black leopard skin, and
some of the silver-mounted shields which are made at
Adowa, and which are carried by the great chiefs
of the country. K. said that if we wrote out an
order and sent it to Adowa it would be attended to.
I wrote out a couple of orders, one for the black
leopard skins and the other for the shields, and we
both signed them and got John to transcribe them
into Amharic. While I was writing them he remarked
that English writing was very quick and very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
different from writing Amharic, in which every letter
has to be formed separately, in the same way as when
we "print" with a pen in English.</p>

<p>Whenever we were in camp for two or three days in
one place it was invariably the custom of the natives
to bring their sick to be healed by the white men, or
else to beg for medicines. They even on one occasion
brought a cripple, carried in a sort of frame: I
suppose they expected me to perform a miracle. On
the present occasion a man came into camp with
a large sore, about the size of the palm of one's
hand, on his shin; he had evidently had it for some
time, and the wound was covered with cow-dung, for
what reason I do not know. I told him to go away
and wash his leg and come back to me with it clean.
I then consulted with Brou what was best to be done
in the case. I had no caustic with me, so I determined
to cauterize it with boiling grease. We had
saved some fat from the cow we had killed; I took a
portion of this, put it into a pan on the fire to boil, and
I informed the man what I was going to do, and that
it would hurt him a great deal, but that if he liked to
let it be done he might. He said, "Do what you like;
I do not care." The grease was very soon melted
and bubbling; I took it off the fire and was going to
apply it, when the servants, who were looking on with
interest, thought it was too hot, and that I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
hurt the man too much, so I let it get cold a little
and poured it on to his leg. He did not seem to feel
it, nor did he wince at all; so I said that would not do,
and that next time I should give it him boiling hot.
I put the pan on the fire again, and when next I
poured the grease on, it fizzed and crackled in the
same way that bacon does; but the most curious
part of the operation was that the man, who a person
would have supposed would have almost fainted
with pain, only winced, much in the same way as
people may be seen to do when they have had a
tooth drawn.</p>

<p>It is difficult to explain this; but it is the case,
that all the black races will endure many surgical
operations of the roughest sort, but directly strong
medicine is given them it seems to kill them at once.
I made the man pour a little milk over the wound,
gave him five rhubarb pills to take, and told him to
go and lie down in the shade. I did not hear afterwards
that he had died, so I think he must have recovered.
I may as well tell the reader that I had a
most excellent medicine-chest with me, and was very
well provided with almost everything that was necessary.
These are the different descriptions of drugs
the chest contained:&mdash;A good quantity of quinine in
two-grain pills, rhubarb pills, chlorodyne, a sedative
solution of opium for diarrh&oelig;a, Warburg's fever tincture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
spermaceti ointment, lint bandages, scissors,
needles and silk for sewing up cuts, &amp;c. But, notwithstanding
all this provision of remedies I managed
to get most terribly ill; indeed one might have a whole
chemist's shop in one's possession, but, without proper
food and comforts, all would be of little use.</p>

<p>Barrakee, who I believe was somewhat of a musician,
was very anxious to hear me play on the
banjo I had with me, so I got it and began playing:
he and the young chief listened for some time, and
then remarked that it was very like Shangalla music.
The Shangalla, or Baria, are the nearest tribe of
negroes to Abyssinia. Barrakee then sent for a sort
of Abyssinian guitar, on which he commenced making
a monotonous noise, and thus ended this rather
eventful day.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 2.</i>&mdash;All to-day I was engaged in quarrelling
over the prices of different donkeys which were brought
in. In the morning H. successfully stalked a flock of
pigeons that had settled on the ploughed ground close
by, and managed to bag five of them with two barrels.
All game is very acceptable, as it always makes an
addition and variation to what provisions are in
hand. We calculated that we should have to buy
twenty donkeys; we had very nearly succeeded in
getting that number, but two more were wanted to
complete the set, and these could not be got either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
for love or money. At last a priest appeared who
was with great difficulty persuaded to lend us his two
donkeys until we could manage to buy from the
neighbouring villages two for ourselves.</p>

<p>This afternoon I thought I would show the young
chief the use of the sword which I had bought in the
market at Semmemar, and so, asking him to let me
look at his own, I showed him the common one I had
purchased, at which he seemed rather to sneer. We
had got the best part of a goat in camp, and I hung
up the hind quarters, with part of the back attached,
on to a rope stretched between the two "dasses"
which had been built for us. The sword was very
sharp, and I managed to cut this piece of the carcass
right in half. I then asked him if he would do the
same, but he said he could not. I rather suspect he
would not, as he was very proud of his sword, and
probably thought that cutting a goat in half would
not be a deed worthy of such a weapon. I then cut
off another piece for his edification, and also to try to
induce him to show off, which, however, he refused to
do, and eventually retired to his followers and Barrakee,
no doubt to talk over what the Feringee had
done, and wonder why he had done it, and what was
the use of the feat.</p>

<p>He came to me again in the evening&mdash;this was
another instance of native imagination of the power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
of the white men to heal and cure&mdash;and informed me,
in a mysterious tone, that his mother had been mad
for some years, and he wanted some medicine to
cure her. I with great difficulty explained to him,
through the interpreter, that it was impossible for us
to cure madness, and that in our country we had
asylums, or houses for mad people, set apart. I said
that anything I could do to alleviate suffering I
should be most happy to attempt. He seemed a
nice young fellow, for in the evening he brought us
some thick cakes made of maize, which he said his
mother had sent us. These were very good and
excellent eating, as we had been living on "damper"
and Peek and Frean's biscuits, which are very dry.

</p>

<p><i>Feb. 3.</i>&mdash;I find I began my rough journal to-day
with these words: "At last we leave this beastly
place, where all has been quarrelling and bargaining."
I certainly was heartily sick of it, and glad to get
away, and so I think were most of us. To make
matters worse, before we started, the servants came
and told us that four of our donkeys were missing,
two that the priest had lent us and two that we had
bought. At this we were furious. H. and I both
agreed that we would not stand this sort of nonsense,
and we went to K. and told him that we thought it
was disgraceful conduct on the part of the chief, and
vowed vengeance on the old sinner. K. tried to
pacify us, and said the donkeys would turn up in
time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly, to say the least of it, it was very annoying,
especially on the point of departure. We called
our servants together and went up to the ballaga's
house where the donkeys had been put for the night.
The young chief evidently thought we had hostile
intentions, as his followers might be seen running in
front of him taking the sheaths off the points of their
long spears. When we got to the house we took up
our position just outside the low wall which surrounded
it.</p>

<p>The young chief was close to a house not many
yards off. I sent word to say that, if the donkeys
were not immediately forthcoming, we should burn
down the man's house and take what goods and
chattels he had there. I went in and took a large
jar of honey and an enormous pumpkin as a sort of
security till the donkeys came. At length the two
donkeys we had bought turned up. We then demanded
the other two which the priest had lent us.
The Abyssinians said, "They are not paid for;" to
which we replied that he would not sell them to us,
but that he promised to lend them, and that, if they
would not give them up, we should do what we had
threatened.</p>

<p>Before going on I may say that we had letters
to send to the post, and it was important they
should start that day, so as to catch the steamer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
which runs every three weeks. As we were now at
loggerheads with the chief, it would have been difficult
to get him to give us a messenger for so long a
journey; but Brou helped me out of this difficulty.
He had a friend among some Mahomedans who lived
not far off, and he told me that if I gave him the
letters they would be given to the head-man of the
Mahomedan village, and that he would insure their
being sent to the coast. Brou made all the arrangements,
and I did not, as usual, see the messenger
myself and make him swear that he would carry the
letters safely. It eventually transpired that they
reached their destination all right; and in fact we
found, all through our journey, that the Mahomedans
were a great deal easier to deal with in business,
bargaining, and arrangements, than the Abyssinians.</p>

<p>I went down into our camp to get the letters and
send them off by Brou, and when I came back I
found K. and H. were rather bored with sitting
there and waiting. K. had been inclined to take the
Abyssinians' part; he said it was one of the usual
events of travelling in such a country, and we should
not make a great fuss; this annoyed us still more.
At last the donkeys were brought and all was
made right. I returned the jar of honey that I had
taken from the house, and I was going to return
the pumpkin, but K. said, "I think we had better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
keep this," a remark that amused us very much, as
he had previously been all for the Abyssinians, and
now he was quite ready to take the native's pumpkin.
These pumpkins make a very good dish, boiled in
water with a little sugar. It is wonderful on occasions
of this sort how "'cute" one gets at foraging for food.
To-day was the only time, during our whole journey,
that I saw a snake. I just caught a glimpse of the
reptile as he wriggled away among some corn sheaves;
he was yellow, and almost of the colour of the corn.</p>

<p>In consequence of the "row" about the donkeys, we
could not start until next day. The old chief, Adik,
came to say good-bye to us. He had never, all through
the time of our stay at Adiaboo, been half so civil as
the younger native, and the servants felt unanimously
that it was owing to him that the donkeys had been
taken; so I intimated that I would not say good-bye
or take any notice of him unless he apologised for all
the trouble he had given us. I had put it very strongly
to his relative, the young man, and told him, in so
many words, I did not think he had behaved as an
Abyssinian chief ought to behave to Englishmen,
when they came to pay a visit to his country. He said
at first that he would not apologise, but at length,
towards the evening, he came up and said he was
very sorry for what had happened, and he hoped
we should have a pleasant journey and lots of sport.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p><i>Feb. 4.</i>&mdash;This morning we really did make a
start, although we had great difficulty in getting
away, as we had fresh servants to look after the
donkeys, the new men did not know the nature
of the packages, and every donkey-load had to be
made out separately by Cassa. We did not go very
far this march, but camped near a little village called
Adikai. The people were very civil, and directly
the young chief, who was with us, told them to put up
a "das," they did so at once. The only little event
which rather disturbed the harmony of the scene was
one of the natives attempting to snatch away one of
our mechanias. I happened to see this, and, running
up to him, gave him a push that sent him clean head
over heels, and I told him to let our things alone;
the people who were looking on all said that it
served him perfectly right.</p>

<p>There was a wedding going on at this village&mdash;in
fact, I believe this was the time of year during which
most of the weddings in Abyssinia take place&mdash;and
the arkees, or groomsmen, who during the week the
wedding is held go about the villages stealing what they
can lay hands on in order to give to the bridegroom,
came and danced before us. It was the same sort of
dance that our coolies had entertained us with on the
Mareb: one stepped forward and went through
various contortions, and then, at one part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
dance, they all sat down and clapped their hands,
making a hissing noise. The young chief said if we
would give them a dollar they would be very pleased;
so we presented them with one, and they went away
delighted. We had bought a quantity of corn at
Adiaboo for food for our servants in the jungle, but
we could not manage to get it ground at Adiaboo;
the young chief, however, said we should be able to do
so in the villages as we went on. He came to us in
the middle of the day and said, "I cannot make the
ballagas grind your corn; you must go through the
villages and make them give you an equal weight of
flour in exchange for your corn." The reason why
he could not make the ballagas of the nearest village
grind the corn was that the village belonged to the
Monastery of Debra Bizen, which my readers will
remember was situated on a high mountain that
overlooked the little valley of Gindar. The priest
of the village said that the young chief had no power
over these people, who paid tribute to the monastery.
We went into the village and said that we must have
some flour, and that we had brought corn to exchange
for it. We sent our servants round to the different
houses to fetch the flour, while a priest, a nice-looking
old fellow in a green turban, looked on to see that
we did not take more than was right. From one of
the little hamlets, to which I went to look for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
flour, all the inhabitants ran away, and clustered on a
hill close by, looking at Brou and myself, who had
walked up to the houses. We ascertained the folks
had just been at their meals, and Brou, who declared
that he had eaten no breakfast that morning, sat down
and demolished the remaining victuals which he found
in the hut. We took what flour we wanted and left
corn in exchange. One of the servants who accompanied
me to carry the corn, wanted as usual to steal
something, but I said I would not allow that, and he
must leave the things just as he found them.</p>

<p>As we came back with the flour that we had exchanged
for corn we met the arkees, and Brou said to
them, "Do not go up to those houses and steal the
things while the people are away, and then say that
we did it!" This was quite right, as these gentlemen
were hanging about, and they would most likely have
made a clean sweep of everything they had found, and
then have said that the Feringee had taken them.
Let me recommend to travellers, when camping near
a native village, to watch for a long string of women,
who generally bring up the water from the nearest
stream. Usually your servants have plenty to do
without going to fetch water: the best way is to take
the water from the women, empty it into your own
vessels, and let them go back and get more for
themselves. This we did with great success at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Adikai, and none of our men had to go and draw
any water at all. Some trifling present soon put the
women in the best of tempers, but I really do not
think they minded the water being taken from them,
only they were terribly afraid lest their jars should
be broken. Most of them, when robbed, began
laughing and chaffing our servants.</p>

<p>The next day we went on to the village of Azho,
and camped in the dry bed of a stream, in a field
where the Dargousa corn had just been cut. Our
camp was below a high plateau on which this large
village was built. It is the frontier village, and after
this you meet no more habitations till you come to
the province of Walkait, which would be from this
point about eight days' travelling on a mule. I had
gone on in front to fix the camp, and found some of
our donkeys, which we had sent on early in the morning,
waiting for us there; by-and-by the whole caravan
came up, after which we enjoyed a very pleasant
swim in a little pool in the river. This is a luxury
which anybody travelling in a hot country will
thoroughly appreciate, as it is impossible to take a
bath with you while travelling in this sort of way; and
we had to do most of our washing in a chillumchee.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>

The young chief and some of his followers came and
begged some powder and bullets: we gave them some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
bullets but very little powder; as it is always
dangerous to give natives powder when they are
likely to be with you, because they might turn your
enemies, and it would be adding insult to injury
to be shot with your own ammunition.</p>

<p>The messenger who had brought our letters from
home to Adiaboo informed us that he had passed
some men on the road who, he believed, were bringing
some guns and ammunition to us. Here at
length was some news of my long-looked-for Express
rifle, and also my heavy rifle. I had intrusted the
carriage of the gun for us to the missionaries who live
at Ailet, and Mr. Lager, the head missionary, said he
would arrange that everything should be forwarded
just as it was passed into his hands from the authorities
at Massowah. Sure enough, about noon the next day,
when we were lounging about camp and doing
nothing&mdash;in fact, waiting for the guns&mdash;I heard a shot
on the other side of the river, and very soon a short
little Abyssinian appeared, dressed in European
costume, followed by some natives carrying a box
and also some other cases. I was very much amused
at his firing the shot, as he strutted into camp with
an air of great importance, and feeling, no doubt,
that he had accomplished a great task. The shot
was to give notice of his presence as he came along.
I never was more pleased in my life; the guns had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
arrived just at the right moment, and all were uninjured
and in as good order as when they had left
the gun-maker's shop in St. James's Street. The
little fellow who had brought them all this long way
was an Abyssinian that the missionaries had reared
and educated. He said he had had great difficulty
in getting along, and one of the coolies, having fallen
sick, had stayed at a village on the road. The first
thing we did was to give them plenty to eat and drink,
such as we had; we then squared accounts with
them, and they were to go back home the next day.
Most of this day was spent in unpacking the ammunition
and guns; they seemed to be all right. To-morrow
we were to start for the Tackazzee, and to
leave all traces of civilisation, of any sort, behind us;
while we were in the highest possible spirits and our
prospects were of the brightest.</p>

<p>That evening I walked out and went up to the village
of Azho to see what it was like: on my way there I
"put up" some quail, but I did not fire at them. Azho
is a large straggling village built on a high plateau,
without any shade in or near it. Some of the natives
showed me the way up a steep hill, where I had
another view of the country we were going to, and I
came back when it was quite dark, having seen a
most beautiful sunset over the hills. H. thought I
was lost, and was very nearly sending out to look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
for me. The country we had been travelling through
from Adiaboo to Azho was very lovely, and the sides
of the low undulating hills were highly cultivated. I
have no doubt, in the valleys, the natives reaped a
rich harvest. The village of Azho itself was a good
specimen of Abyssinian dwellings; the people seemed
well-to-do, and the houses carefully and neatly built.
There was a custom-house here, where cotton from
Walkait and other distant provinces paid tribute.
Before I go on, I must say that the transport of my
guns from the village of Ailet to where we were at
Azho cost 46 dollars, and the coolies considered
themselves well paid.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 6.</i>&mdash;I started off, before H., with a guide to
show me the way, but we chanced, somehow or other,
to lose our road, and I was greatly annoyed. This
march I did on foot, as my grey mule, which had a
very sore back, had to be left behind at Adiaboo. K.
procured me another, but it was a sorry brute, and
always kicked when being mounted, so I got rid
of it. After wandering about some little time in the
jungle, trying to find our way, we at length hit upon
the path, and saw some of our own donkeys, under the
care of Hadji Mahomet, travelling along. We were
to camp at a place called Maidarou, the usual camping-place
on this road for all caravans. There were two
very large trees close to the pools which supplied us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
with water, and we were very glad of their shade
after the march of the day. For myself, I was rather
tired, and was not in very good working condition,
having through most of our marching been riding a
mule. After having lunched we pitched our tents on
the flat top of a little rocky hill which just overlooked
the two large trees that formed the great feature in this
camping-place. On my road here I shot at a gazelle,
but, unluckily, the man who was carrying my Express
rifle was some distance behind, and so I could only fire
at it with my little 16-bore gun with a bullet. The
next day we were to come to a place called Coom-Coom-Dema.</p>

<p>This is the head-quarters of those Abyssinians who
come down to hunt elephants, for the young Abyssinians,
that is to say the gentlemen of the country,
think it part of their education to come here to shoot
elephants. There are regular ivory hunters, who
live at Azho and the villages near, and these go down
to assist. The young Abyssinians who seek to distinguish
themselves shoot at the elephant with small
shot or slugs, just enough to draw blood, and then it
is left to the Neftenias, or hunters, to finish him off
with bullets. Their mode of hunting is rather curious.
When they see the elephant, of course they stalk him
with great care: two lines are made; the first line, on
coming up to the elephant, fire and take to their heels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
as quickly as possible. If the elephant is wounded, he
very often charges, and then meets the second line,
who receive him with a greater number of shots;
they then follow him up, if badly wounded, and
despatch him at their leisure. The Abyssinians are,
as a rule, bad sportsmen, and seem to me to be totally
unacquainted with the commonest rules of wood-craft.
I would recommend all sportsmen who hunt in a wild
country to adapt their dress as much as possible to
the colour of the landscape in which they find themselves.
I always shot in brown cord breeches and
flax gaiters, with a good cumberbund<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
 round my
waist, and a short-tailed coat, which was made of
strong cotton stuff that I bought in India.</p>

<p>All the servants with us, as well as the followers of
the young chief, were in a tremendous fright because
of the Baria, the negro tribe of which I spoke before,
and who came up to this part of the country to hunt
the elephant, and also to kill whatever Abyssinians
they could find. I myself never saw one of these
redoubtable natives, nor do I believe they would
attempt to attack a well-armed party; but in the
evening, over the camp fire, many terrible stories
were told of how So-and-so was murdered, and how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
cunning and treacherous the Baria were. Brou, the
interpreter, was not behindhand in telling us all
sorts of terrible things about them. One story he
told us was this: There was a man who lived in a
village close to the frontier, and who had to pay
tribute to the chief of his province in ivory. He had
gone down to the desert, or jungle, to hunt the
elephant alone; a wily Baria following him most of
the time. It should be stated that this tribe of natives
have no fire-arms, and only hunt and destroy with
spears and knives. The elephant-hunter was stalking
an elephant, and had come up to him; at the moment
he fired, the Baria, who had been sneaking after
him, jumped up from behind, drove his knife into him,
and killed him. This is a good example of their
treachery; but the Abyssinians are just as much to
blame in regard to the Baria or Shangallas, for whenever
the Abyssinians catch them in much smaller
numbers than themselves they generally kill them.</p>

<span class="s08"><i>To face page 147.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Feb. 7.</i>&mdash;H. went on in front to Coom-Coom-Dema:
I said that as it was early I should shoot
over part of the country and join him later. I went
away into the jungle, which lay south of our camp,
and came upon some old elephant tracks. I had not
gone very much farther before I saw some gazelles;
I managed to get near one of them, and, as it was
racing away on the side of a little hill, I rolled it over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
with my Express. My gun-bearers very soon skinned
it, and they having succeeded in lighting a fire, I said
they might eat some of it. The way an Abyssinian
hunter makes a fire in the jungle is this: he takes some
of his powder and rubs it on a bit of cotton cloth which
he tears off the clothes he is wearing, and then wraps
up a percussion cap in the cloth and hammers the cap
between two stones till it explodes; this ignites the
dry cloth, and with the help of some twigs and grass,
and by blowing very hard on the smouldering cotton,
he manages to light a fire. It is wonderful how natives
under the most trying circumstances will kindle a
flame where no European would think such a thing
possible.</p>

<p>My gun-bearers were soon roasting the hind-quarters
of the gazelle on the ashes, and also eating some parts
of it raw. I was sitting down under the shade of a
tree, and heard Goubasee behind me munching something;
I turned round, and was much disgusted at
seeing him eating the stomach of a gazelle, which was
not in the least washed, and in fact was a filthy sight.
This is considered a great delicacy by Abyssinians,
especially when the stomach is covered with the
green undigested food of the animal. After we had
all rested, and they had eaten sufficient, we tracked
back on our old path, and soon struck the regular
caravan road. I thought it would have been a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
walk, but, to my astonishment, the hills opened and I
saw in front of me a large plain&mdash;this was the plain of
Coom-Coom-Dema. H. had pitched the tents, and
everything was ready and comfortable. Just after we
had lunched, one of the servants said that he could
see on the plain some large deer, which he called
<i>tora</i>; they were in reality hartebeest. They were
going down to drink from the pool where we got
our water, but directly they saw us they trotted off.
Some gazelles got up as we were walking along, and
I fired and missed, so did H. There were tracks
of buffalo all about our camp, but they were very
old, having been made during the rains. Barrakee,
who had undertaken the sporting arrangements of
the party, said this was a very good place for game,
but we determined not to stop here, but to press on
to the Tackazzee, the goal of my ambition.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 8.</i>&mdash;This morning we were almost awakened by
the noise the little sand-grouse made in circling round
and round our tents. I got up and brought down two
brace of them, as they wheeled round attempting to
settle on some ground close to our camp. It was
rather pretty shooting, as the birds came very fast, and
I only wished that I could have had some more of it,
but the rest of the pack soon got frightened and went
away. After this we packed up our traps and left
Coom-Coom-Dema. On the road, Barrakee, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
riding a large white horse, pointed me out a herd of
giraffes about half a mile off. I attempted to stalk
them, but did not succeed in getting near them. They
went off at a slight ambling pace, and when once they
had crossed the little hill, on the near side of which
they were feeding, I could not see them again. Fisk
had come with me, and we were both very anxious to
kill something. I shot at some sort of deer, but
missed, and on my way back saw a gazelle, at which
I did not fire.</p>

<p>When I came back to the road, completely parched
with thirst, as it was very hot, I found that all our
donkeys had stopped: this was very vexing, as my
great object was to get on now as quickly as possible.
Brou said the donkeys were very heavily loaded, that
the day was hot, and that there was no prospect
of getting water between where we were and the
Tackazzee. This was simply untrue; for when I found
Barrakee and talked to him upon the subject, it turned
out that there was water farther on; so I immediately
made them reload the donkeys and push on. Barrakee
fixed our camp by the edge of a dry river-bed, in
which there was left a large pool of water, and there
were tracks of elephants having drunk here some
time previously. We cleared the high grass from
the jungle and pitched our tents, after which H.
went out shooting, but did not get anything. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
it was dark we saw jungle fires in the distance,
which our servants all said had been kindled by
the Baria to burn us out. This, of course, was all
humbug, or they had nothing better to talk about.
The place we camped at was called Kourasa, or the
house of the long-tailed monkey, and this water-hole
which we were camped by, Barrakee told us, is a regular
drinking-place for elephants; he added, with much
mystery and fear, that perhaps they might come in
the night and trample on our camp. I only hoped
they would! The natives assured me that we should
find the Tackazzee next day; and, accordingly, in the
morning we started, H. having gone on in front with
the young chief.

</p>

<p><i>Feb. 9.</i>&mdash;To-day I was to take charge of the heavy
baggage and donkeys; this we generally took it in
turns to do. I caught H. up at a river, where I
found them all drinking. He went on directly, and
I stopped for an hour to rest our twenty-one donkeys
and their drivers, and to let them have something
to drink. The country we were travelling through had
changed; we were at a much lower level than we had
been before, and dome-palms grew in every direction,
the shorter and younger ones of which made a thick
jungle which we pushed our way through, the leaves
causing a great rattling as we went on. This was
much more my idea of an African forest than anything
I had ever seen before. I saw a hagazin on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
side of a hill near me, and tried to stalk it. I got so
close to the animal that I could hear him making a
peculiar grunting noise close to me, but for the life of
me, in the thick jungle, I could not make out where
he was. I moved on a little farther, and then I saw
him trotting away in the distance. Elephant tracks
were to be seen in all directions crossing the main path
along which we travelled, and fresh elephant dung was
here in quantities.</p>

<p>I travelled on through the forest and came upon
the party of the young chief, who was waiting
for me by some water, H. having come across
elephants and gone after them. I asked the little
chief why he had not gone with him to hunt
elephants; he said, in the most polite way, that he was
staying behind to wait for me. I thanked him, and
determined to push on again and make the Tackazzee
that day. Mahomet, one of the coolies, or rather
donkey-drivers, that we had brought with us from
Adiaboo, volunteered to act as guide. I pushed on as
quickly as possible, and, about half-past four in the
afternoon, the servants pointed out the Tackazzee.
There, sure enough, was a broad river below me, running
between high rocky hills, with its waters gleaming
in the setting sun. I was standing several hundred
feet above it, and on the left of me, on the same side
on which I was, was a green jungle of grass and tamarisk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
bushes fringing the bank of the river. A large
herd of hagazin had just been drinking, and they were
moving quietly away, the males leading and the
hinds following with the little fawns trotting at their
feet. The whole scene was really a beautiful one, and
I stopped for some little time to admire the view
which lay before me. The natives had pointed out
the antelope to me, but I was too excited to take
any notice, so I gave them a view-halloo, and told the
guide to lead me to the bottom of the hill where the
river ran. When we got down into the green jungle
which fringed the bank of the river it was so high we
could not see over it, and pushing on through it, we
soon found ourselves on the shingly bed of the river.
The water was beautifully clear, and I gladly drank
a draught of it. We then forded the river with
some of the more lightly-laden donkeys, which had
managed to keep up and follow me. Goubasee, on
his arrival at the other side, held up his hands and
exclaimed, "God has brought us safely here!" I was
so pleased to see a large river again that I took off
my boots and paddled about in the water, for almost
the last fresh-water stream of a good size I had seen
was the one on which the Citizen penny steamers
glide.</p>

<p>We had brought down two cows from Adiaboo with
us, and these animals were very nearly swept away by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the stream, where they would have been devoured by
crocodiles. The man who had charge of them lost his
head, and became very nearly as frightened as were
the beasts themselves; at last some of the servants
rushed into the water, got below the cows, and drove
them back to the bank they started from. They then
attempted again, and crossed in safety. I fixed the
camp amidst a large grove of dome-palms; a prettier
place could not well be imagined. The ground was
perfectly flat; in fact, as if it had been thoroughly
stamped down. There was a beautiful shade of a large
leafy tree close by, but unluckily, as is often the case
in Eastern climes, where the scene is of the loveliest
the place is most unwholesome; and, as proved afterwards,
most of us, myself included, fell ill, which I
believe was a great deal owing to our not having fixed
our camp on one of the high hills that overlooked the
river, instead of down in the river-bed. <i>Experientia
docet</i>, and, as my readers will see afterwards, I paid
dearly for what little experience I gained in rough
travel in this country.</p>

<p>I heard, in a pool below the ford where we had
crossed, some animals making an unusual noise, grunting
and blowing. I went down with my gun-bearers to
the edge of the river, and, behold! there were eight
fine hippopotami disporting themselves in the river,
much in the same way as the old river-horse at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Zoo may be seen swimming about his tank. They
reared themselves out of the water and exposed
their heads and part of their necks, sometimes
opening their enormous jaws so that I could see
their white tusks. I fired at the nearest of the
herd, and hit him behind the ear. He began
bleeding profusely, and waltzed round and round in
the water, causing tremendous waves. At last in about
half an hour he sank, and we saw him no more. I
shot at several more and, I believe, killed another, but
we saw no traces of them again; and I think it is a
great chance, in a large rapid river of this sort, if
their carcases are found at all. I sent servants during
the following days up and down the river, but they
were quite unsuccessful in finding any trace of the
beasts. H. did not come in till late, having gone
after an elephant he had wounded. He told me they
had found large clots of blood on the animal's track,
but that he had to give up as they were getting far
away from our line of march and from any water-pools.
Cassa arrived very late with the rest of the
donkeys. He assured us that one of the Baria had
fired the jungle in a circle, and so had tried to surround
him and some of the more heavily-laden donkeys
which had lagged behind. This was quite believed
by all our servants, and it made a great impression
on some of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p><i>Feb. 10.</i>&mdash;To-day we rested most of the morning.
In the afternoon I went down to the pool where the
hippopotami were, but they had got much more shy,
and showed only just the tops of their heads and their
wicked-looking little ears above water. As one
opened his jaws I hit him smack in the mouth; this
sounded just as if a bullet had gone into a stack of
faggots. He sank immediately, and I could not in the
least tell whether I had killed him or not. As these
hippopotami had got so shy, I commenced to-day,
with the help of Brou, to make a raft on which to try
and go down the river to them. Some of the dome-palms
had fallen down from old age and from the
effects of the floods that sweep by during the rainy
season; I proposed to lash these together with raw
hide, but I had nothing except a hand-saw to cut the
logs the proper length, and the palm wood was very
hard and the weather very hot.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 11.</i>&mdash;We had arranged with Barrakee to go for
three days and sleep out, or bivouac, and hunt
elephants; we accordingly started straight inland
towards the mountains of Walkait. After we had
crossed the hills, under which the Tackazzee ran, we
came upon a sort of open plain with little hills cropping
up here and there, and we had been following
fresh elephant tracks the whole time. I must not
forget to mention that during the night a large herd of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
elephants had passed close to our camp, and that all
the jungle round was trampled and broken in every
direction. I just remember, in a half-sleepy state,
hearing strange noises, but I thought at the time
that it was only the "hippos" disporting themselves
in the pool below. At last Barrakee, who was going
in front, said that we were getting very close to the
elephants, and that we must leave our mules behind
us, and follow them up the rest of the way on foot.
Not long afterwards we saw two elephants in the
distance moving slowly along. We tried to stalk
them, but we did not succeed. Barrakee took us to
some water, where we drank, and close by which, as
we came up to it, were some pigs lying asleep under
a tree. An Abyssinian tried to knock one over with
the butt of his gun, for we did not like to fire, being
so close to the elephants.</p>

<p>After we had halted for a little time and rested ourselves,
Barrakee said we should move on, and he took
us to the top of a steep little hill, where he said we
were to pass the night, and from whence we could see
the whole country round us. Brou, and a couple of men
that Barrakee had with him, built us a "das." We ate
some luncheon, and then we sat down to watch for any
elephant that might perchance be about. We had thus
waited for about an hour when Barrakee leaped up and
said he saw two elephants in the distance, so we got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
our guns and went off to stalk them. The elephants
were walking towards the south, following the main
body of the herd which had passed very early in the
morning. Our object was to cut them off on their
way, and Barrakee led us sometimes over the low
hills, and sometimes round the sides of them, and we
gradually approached nearer the two elephants, who
were moving along swinging their trunks about, and
sometimes stopping to pick off a bit of a shrub which
looked more dainty than the rest. At last there
was only one little hill for us to go over, and to cross
it would bring us right across the path of the two
elephants. We were creeping along very quietly
when, as we came to a few rocks, where, in the
rainy season, a torrent evidently poured down, Barrakee
stopped suddenly and said, "Ambasa!" which
is Amharic for lion. I snatched hold of my Express,
rushed up and saw a fine male lion moving slowly
away among the rocks. At the moment I was going
to fire, H. came up and fired his heavy rifle close
behind me; both barrels went off at once, and I thought
at first I was shot, as nine drams of powder is rather
a large charge to be let off close to one's ear. I missed
the lion; so did H. I loaded again and ran after
him and fired, and missed. The elephants, which were
not more than forty or fifty yards off, went off in
another direction, and the lion, passing through some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
trees, "put up" a herd of large deer which went also
in a different direction. It was a sight grand enough,
but we had made a terrible mess of the whole thing:
we ought not to have fired at the lion, and, as the servants
said, "If you had killed the elephants, plenty of
lions would have come to pick the bones." I may tell
my readers that the lions in Abyssinia are not like
the familiar picture that is everywhere to be seen of
animals with enormous manes, as the species in this
country have no mane at all. We then walked back
to the little hill whereon we were to camp that night,
all of us disappointed and crestfallen. The whole
of the top of this hill was covered with the most
beautiful sweet-smelling grass, and of this we gathered
a large quantity to make our beds. I had arranged
with one of our servants to bring out my little camp
bed and blankets, but, as we went away from camp
rather quickly, following up the tracks of the elephant,
the native lost his way, and I had nothing to cover
me but some sacking, which the medicine case was
wrapped up in. That night we slept very comfortably
and warmly, as the grass made a capital bed.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 12.</i>&mdash;This day we moved away on the track
of the herd of elephants. The jungle became denser,
and Barrakee halted us by a beautiful stream of
water, and pointed out a hill close by, where he
said we should camp that night. A little river that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
we were near was full of small fish, and I amused
myself by trying to catch some of them by damming
up a part of the river, but I did not succeed. After
luncheon I went up the stream, and found Barrakee
and H. seated on a rock engaged in trying to
catch some fish; one of them with a crooked pin, and
the other with the only hook we had in camp.
Amongst us we managed to lift three out of the
water; these I cleaned and brought them back into
camp for dinner. After catching the fish we took a
most delicious swim in the pool. That night, unluckily
for me, there was no grass to be found, and I
borrowed a blanket from Brou, but, foolishly, instead
of covering myself up with it, I rolled it up and used
it as a pillow. I caught a chill in the night, and
in consequence, found myself suffering from severe
diarrh&oelig;a in the morning. From this day date all my
troubles, illness, and misfortunes. It certainly was
very unfortunate, as we had only just got into the
country where the game was really to be found.</p>

<p>This only shows how particularly careful one ought
to be when leading a life of this sort, and especially
when sleeping out in the open air. A good thick
flannel belt should always be worn next the skin.
What I really believe gave me this chill was that I
took off the cumberbund, which had been wound
tightly round my waist, in order to sleep more comfortably.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
This proceeding was a terrible mistake, as
it is in the night time and the early dawn that these
chills are acquired, which prove at all times most
deadly, especially in a hot climate.</p>

<p>On the whole, I should consider Abyssinia to be a
very healthy country. The only two complaints which
Europeans seem to suffer from are intermittent fevers&mdash;which
are not, as a rule, of a very dangerous nature&mdash;and
dysentery, which, of course, if proper remedies
and suitable food are at hand, is not serious, but
under other circumstances may prove very dangerous.
Let me urge upon all travellers who go to seek adventure
and sport in Africa to remember to keep their
heads well protected from the sun, and their loins well
girded with either a thick cumberbund, worn outside,
or, better still, a flannel belt worn next the skin.
Every one will notice that the natives are dressed in
this way, especially the Arabs who live at Massowah,
where the climate is very hot. It would be useless
for me to go into the different diseases the natives of
the country are subject to. There is one which I have
already mentioned, that is the tænia, or tapeworm.
They are also subject to intermittent fevers during
the rains, and suffer from a complaint caused by a
parasite called the Guinea worm, which is a worm that
forms in the flesh, very often the thigh, and has to be
gradually twisted out. If during the operation the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
worm breaks, a horrible ulcer forms. As to scrofula
and its origin, I saw very little of it, the natives
seeming, on the whole, pretty free from this terrible
scourge. When a person among them is afflicted with
very bad rheumatism they have rather an original way
of effecting a cure, which is by putting bits of cotton
on the parts affected, and igniting them, making them
burn fiercely by blowing upon the cotton. This is
even sometimes done for the purpose of creating
beauty marks, as they are considered&mdash;a young man
showing his fortitude by allowing one of the fair sex
to light one of these bits of cotton, and blow on it to
create as much heat as possible. If by any chance he
flinches, or shows any indication of pain, he is thought
to be a coward, and not worthy of the lady's notice.
Concerning this mode of curing rheumatism, I believe
there is some similar custom among country people
in England, the <i>modus operandi</i> being a heated flat
iron with which the affected limb is treated.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 13.</i>&mdash;I rode out this morning on my mule
through a green, thorny jungle which lay opposite the
hill on which we were camped. I was on the lookout
for big game, and so did not fire at a large flock
of guinea-fowl which I put up: there must have been
at least two or three hundred of them, and they all
rose at once, making a tremendous row. It was a
very pretty sight, and one quite peculiar to the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
which I was in. I felt very seedy, and disinclined
to do anything; and so having gone straight through
this patch of jungle I came to the little stream again,
where I sat down by a pool, and waited there for most
of the day, in hopes of some animal coming down to
drink. Barrakee, who had been out in a different
direction with H., not long after I had been here,
came up, and H. went on down the stream, while
Barrakee and myself watched over the pool. A little
gazelle came to drink: instead of my waiting in order
to get a broadside shot, I fired at it while it was
looking at me, and the result was to break one of its
fore-legs. Barrakee rushed after it, but we saw no
more of it. I then mounted my mule, which had been
grazing close by, and rode home into camp. Our
three days were over, our provisions finished, and we
resolved the next day, which was Sunday, to start for
home.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 14.</i>&mdash;I was worse to-day, and we started early
for our camp on the Tackazzee. The servants, while
we had been absent, had, according to arrangement,
moved the camp away from the river; Fisk had been
left in charge. The reason of this move was they
were all very much frightened of the Baria, and
thought, as we should be absent with our guns, that
it would be better if they got away from the river,
by whose banks the Baria are supposed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
always lurking. I rode towards camp feeling very
desponding, and on the way H. fired at some pig,
and wounded one badly, but the beast managed to
get away, leaving large tracks of blood on its path.
We also saw some strange-looking deer, of a colour
resembling that usual with donkeys, but with short
horns curving back from their foreheads like those
of goats: they stood, I should think, very nearly
fourteen hands from the ground. On our way back
we passed the spot which had been the scene of our
unlucky exploit with the lion, and, curiously enough,
two gazelles came bounding past at the time, but we
succeeded in missing them; we were fated to kill no
game in this place. When I rode into camp, Hadji
Mahomet, the old native we had brought from
Massowah, came up to welcome us back, and said, in
Arabic, "Allah has brought you safely back." I felt
very much inclined to reply, and I believe I did at
the time, "No, my mule has brought me back," as I
felt very disappointed, and looked upon the expedition
we had made as a total failure. I was very glad to
get into a comfortable bed, as the coolie, who had lost
his way, had succeeded in finding the camp the servants
had pitched a little way off from the Tackazzee.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 15.</i>&mdash;I was still bad with this horrid complaint,
and so I stayed in camp reading the few books
we had with us, and took medicine; I also amused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
myself by making a small model of the raft that
I proposed to use when hunting the hippopotami, in
order that Brou might understand how to go on
working at it. H. and Fisk went out shooting partridges
to make broth for me. There were not nearly
so many partridges here on the Tackazzee as we
found on the Mareb; for the tamarisk bushes which
fringe the banks of the Mareb were, as a rule, full of
them. With a couple of dogs we might really have
had some very good shooting, and made big bags;
but without dogs it was almost impossible to get the
birds up, as they ran so tremendously; but when they
did get up they were not hard to shoot, as they did
not seem to fly nearly so strongly as the English
birds, which they very much resembled, with one exception,
which was that their bills and legs were red,
the plumage being exactly the same. We tried to
keep some of the birds, in order to give them that
gamy flavour which is esteemed in England; but the
weather was too hot, and the flesh got bad too
quickly. The rapid setting-in of decomposition was
a great drawback when a beast was killed in camp, as
the meat had to be eaten almost immediately; but,
both in its raw and cooked state, it is surprising what
a quantity the natives will manage to consume.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 16.</i>&mdash;To-day I was very much better, the
medicine seemed to have done me good; but, instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
of staying in camp and perfecting my cure, I stupidly
went out and did a hard day's work, standing up to
my middle under water in a hot sun, to complete the
raft. The raft when finished was, to speak fairly, a
great success. It was made in the following way:
Six logs of the dome-palm tree were lashed with raw
hide, cut from the skin of one of the cows which we
had killed in camp; the logs were lashed to two cross
pieces, and from one cross piece to the other I fixed
two thin pliable boughs, under which I jammed a lot
of dry "hippopotamus grass" (the long grass growing
by the side of the river), which had been cut a
day or two before and put out in the sun on the
shingly bank of the river to dry. The grass was
jammed in under these thin sticks, so that it went
across the logs and made a place for any one to
stand in, and also assisted in promoting the buoyancy
of the raft.</p>

<p>A caravan of about three or four hundred people
came across the river to-day on their way to
Walkait. These caravans generally assemble in
Tigré, in order to make up a large number, so that
their goods may be properly cared for in case of
any attack by the Baria. One man among them
had a couple of very good-looking donkeys; he
must have procured them from some of the Arab
tribes who live on the borders of the country; I tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
to buy one of the donkeys, but the man wanted a
great deal too much for it. The caravan only stayed
close to our camp during the heat of the day, and in
the afternoon they moved on. They were bringing
back grain and salt, having taken out cotton to the
different towns in the province of Tigré.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 17.</i>&mdash;I am better to-day, and I worked at the
raft to put the finishing touches to it. In the afternoon
I went out fishing, and I had put on a hook with a piece
of raw meat as bait, having made a rod of two bamboo
sticks spliced together. I caught nothing, nor did I
even get a bite. I was sitting in camp towards the
evening when one of the coolies rushed in to say that
he had seen some elephants on the other side of the
river, a little way down, looking very much as if they
were going to cross the river. Barrakee was in camp.
I took my guns, and he, with two of his men and my
gun-bearers, went out to look for the elephants. We
crept along the bank of the river, and on the other
side Barrakee pointed out two fine bull elephants;
they were standing amongst the dense jungle which
bordered the river, evidently undecided whether to
cross or not. H. and Fisk were out shooting partridges
for our dinner, and just as we saw the elephants
we heard two shots. This was very unlucky, but H.
had no idea that there were elephants near. It must
have startled them, as very shortly afterwards we saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
them crashing away through the forest. It was a
very pretty picture to see these huge animals standing
amongst the thick trees and jungle, the rays of the
setting sun, at the time, just lighting up the broad
and sparkling river as it ran below us&mdash;the whole
being a thoroughly wild African scene, and one which
any lover of sport would have appreciated. I should
say that whilst fishing that afternoon I left a hand-line
in charge of a native, who afterwards assured me,
when I asked him if he had had a bite, that some
big fish had taken hold of it and pulled him on to his
knees; certainly one of his knees was a little bit
bruised by the stones. The thermometer here ranged
from 109° to 115° in the tent, in the middle of the
day; so my readers may imagine it was pretty hot.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 18.</i>&mdash;To-day Brou got the raft ready for
launching, and a large caravan of nearly four hundred
people came across the river, most of whom camped
close by. One of our messengers, whom we had
employed to carry letters for us to the coast, had
taken this opportunity of joining the caravan in
order to bring the letters down to us. Arrekel Bey,
the Governor of Massowah, had sent me some French
newspapers, so we were well posted up in all the news.
The chief of the caravan had been very kind to our
coolie, who was named Givra Michael, and had
given him food during the journey. We sent for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the chief and talked some time with him: he told me
he was taking his people, and cows, and belongings,
back to his home in Walkait, the country then being at
peace. There are very often feuds and disputes going
on among the petty chiefs, especially in this part
of Abyssinia. I amused the Abyssinian by showing
him my guns and revolvers, and, for his edification,
fired at a mark with one of my revolvers: he was
much astonished at the rapidity with which the revolver
went off. I made him a present of a pocket-handkerchief
and two hanks of beads, with which he
was very much delighted. I had with me at the
time Rassam's book, called 'British Mission to Abyssinia;'
in the frontispiece of the first volume is a
picture of King Theodore, and this I showed to the
chief and most of his followers. They were intensely
interested with it, and said the likeness was
very good. It was very amusing to hear their remarks
and to see the expression on their faces as the
picture was handed round. I went out fishing in the
evening, but some monster of the deep ran out about
seventy yards of my line so fast that I could scarcely
hold it. I am rather better to-day, having taken some
opium.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 19.</i>&mdash;Brou came to me this morning to tell
me that Barrakee was suffering from diarrh&oelig;a, and
begged I would give him a little brandy and water. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
also discovered that others of the servants were suffering
from the same complaint; indeed none of them
looked very well. I consulted with H., and it was
agreed that we should move camp to-night, there
being a full moon at the time, which afforded plenty of
light to travel by. I launched the raft in the afternoon,
and got it safely over the rapids that we had
forded, and moored it on the left bank of the river, a
little above the hippopotamus pool. I thought at
the time that perhaps a change up into the more
bracing air of the hills would do myself, as well as
the rest of the party, some good, and that we might
before leaving the country return here; but my wishes
were never realized. That evening we dined early and
left camp about eight o'clock, having burned all our
"dasses" (or leaf-houses), which made a tremendous
blaze, and the scene certainly was a wild one. Before
coming down to the Tackazzee I had presented all
the servants with a piece of red cloth, which they put
round their heads, and by the light of the blazing
sticks they looked more like so many devils than
human beings. They were scantily clothed, and the
red handkerchiefs gave them a fierce and wild appearance.
We crossed the river, bathed in the light
of a full tropical moon, then marched up along the
road that we had come by, and we pitched camp near
some water in the jungle at 10.45. I was a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
better, but the ride up from the river tired me a good
deal.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 20.</i>&mdash;My complaint is about the same, but I do
not suffer so much pain from it. I took three doses
of opium, but this medicine makes one feel very
weak. I amused myself in the afternoon learning
an Abyssinian game called Galanift, which is played
in the following way: twelve small holes are dug in
the ground, six in a row opposite each other; four
pellets, or bullets, are put into each hole; A takes
one row, and B the other. They sit down opposite
each other, and the object of the game is to take
the adversary's bullets by certain moves, which are
all made from left to right. It is something like
the game called Solitaire, but is very complicated,
and requires the exertion of your powers of mental
arithmetic to understand it.

</p>

<p><i>Feb. 21.</i>&mdash;I have nothing of great importance to
tell about this day. I lost my pencil, that I used
to write my diary with, and I was obliged to use
as a substitute the sad remains of the only quill
pen left me, and which I managed to render serviceable
by tying it on to a bit of stick. As I
have so little to say, I will give you a sketch of our
day in camp. It begins mostly at sunrise. The
first thing that happens is that the donkeys and
mules are untethered and led out to grass. Our
water-barrel is taken down to the stream or pool
which we are camped by, to be filled; it takes about
three men to carry it up again full. When the water
is brought up the kettles are put on to boil, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Mahomet, who is my servant, and Fisk, H.'s servant,
get ready our things for dressing. We get
up and generally perform our ablutions in the open
air, with our little basin either propped upon the
stump of a tree or else on a heap of stones close to
the tent. We breakfast about eight, and then go out
shooting&mdash;that is to say, I used to do so when I
was well. Fisk serves out the servants' rations for
the day about ten o'clock, and a very few minutes
after this all hands are hard at work making their
bread, which is accomplished by mixing flour and
water and making the whole mass into a plaster-of-Paris-like
paste.</p>

<p>Most of our servants have divided themselves into
messes of three or four, and the way in which they
bake their bread is both original and primitive. Well-to-do
travellers in Abyssinia, generally carry an iron
pan, exactly the shape of one of the copper scale
pans that grocers weigh tea in, but the poorer
natives have to content themselves with a flat stone,
numbers of which are to be seen, propped up on
other stones, at all the camping-places on the road,
with the ashes of recent fires beneath them. While
they are making their paste the stone is being
heated over a fire, and directly it is hot enough they
pour on to it the liquid dough and let it bake;
when it is done on one side they turn it over like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
pancake. When sufficiently cooked it is a hot doughy
sort of flat cake; and those people who are lucky
enough to have a little red pepper eat it with the
bread. There is nothing of which an Abyssinian is
so fond as red pepper, and the quantity he manages
to pass down his throat is something surprising.
We had a good deal of rice with us, and had found
that by grinding the rice between two smooth flat
stones, which we got from the bed of the Tackazzee,
it made excellent flour; and we had hot rice cakes,
baked in Brou's iron pan, every morning for breakfast.
After breakfast, if I did not go out shooting,
there was generally something to do in camp, either
to mend or put the men to work at making ropes, out
of the fibre of a certain tree, for lashing our things
together, or else sending them to cut grass for our
"das," or leaf-house, which we live in during the day,
as these bowers are always much cooler when they are
well thatched with grass. Sometimes we have tiffin,
and sometimes not. It is usually hottest between one
and three in the afternoon, and then it is always
best to be in camp. In the evening we generally
went out shooting till dark. The donkeys and mules,
having been taken to water, are brought in about five
o'clock and tethered; they are left to stand till
dark, when the grass that has been cut is given them
for the night. We dined between seven and eight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
and after dinner the flour was served out to the
servants for their evening meal. Any arrangements
were now made for the day following. H. and I
sat by the camp fire, generally played a tune upon
my banjo, and then, after enjoying a smoke, we
turned in to rest.</p>

<p class="p2">After dinner is one of the pleasantest times in
this beautiful climate; the stars shine brightly, and
from the place where we were now encamped the constellations,
both of the Great Bear and the Southern
Cross, could be seen. For the last week I had been
so unwell that I had not written up my journal.
Symptoms of dysentery had appeared, and I was
afraid I should be laid up. During this week H.
had been out shooting, and he and Barrakee had the
luck between them to kill a large koodoo. Of course
all hands in camp were delighted, and a great portion
of the meat was "jerked," that is to say, hung up in
the sun and dried. We found, at first, this jerked
meat was very hard to eat, but by grinding it between
two stones, mixing it with a little rice, fat,
and onions, and then making it into a sort of rissole
and frying it, it did not make at all a bad meal.</p>

<p>One day during this week H. went out after
elephants, and saw a very large herd; he said there
must have been about eighty of them, but when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
herd winded the hunters, they trumpeted and separated
about the country. Two of them were making
down a little ravine, close to where H., Barrakee,
and the gun-bearer, were standing. H. told me
that Plowden Gubrihote, his gun-bearer, was in a
dreadful "funk," and assured him that these elephants
were the man-killing elephants, well known
in this part of the world; that they would surely kill
them if they did not immediately take to their heels
and run away. H. told him to sit still, or else he
would "lick" him. The elephants came nearer and
nearer, and one of Barrakee's men put up his gun to
fire. This would have been ridiculous, as they were
nearly eighty yards off. H. knocked the gun out of
his hand, and told him to sit quiet. The elephants
were now fast approaching, when Barrakee and his man
both fired. This was exceedingly annoying, as from
all accounts the elephants would have passed by close
to where the party were concealed, and H. would have
had a capital shot.</p>

<p>We stopped in the jungle here rather more than a
week. I thought perhaps another change of air would
do me good, and we moved up to Kourasa, where we
had been camped before. I did not know at the time
that I was so ill, nor did H., or else I should not
have made the proposal I did when we got here. I
told H. that our time was short in the country, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
it was of very little use his stopping with me; I
thought he had better move on with Barrakee, who
assured us that, in the country near his village on the
frontier, we should find very good shooting, even much
better than we had had before. H. left me a few
servants behind, and four or five donkeys. We were
getting short of flour, and we agreed that he should
go on to Barrakee's village, send me back flour for the
servants, and that I, on the day after he left, would
move up to Coom-Coom-Dema and stop there till the
flour arrived. Accordingly the next day he started
away in the morning. Just as he left, luckily I said
to him, "I think you had better leave me five dollars of
our money, in case of accidents." This was literally all
the coin I had with me when I started to go to the coast.</p>

<p>I started the next day for Coom-Coom-Dema,
and very nearly lost my way; my gun-bearers did
not seem to remember it, and it was only by chance
that I recollected some trees and a low hill which
guided me across the plain to where we had been encamped
before. When I arrived I felt very bad indeed,
and I was really exceedingly ill. The flour had run out,
and I had to serve out some rice that evening to my
servants; for myself I had some biscuits to eat. I
hoped by the morning of the next day to receive flour
from H., but it never came, and the servants had no
food nearly all that day, except some scraps that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
they had managed to save. The next morning I had
nothing to give them, but they seemed to bear it all
without complaint. I went out to try and kill some
of the little sand-grouse for myself, but I did not
succeed. When I came into camp Petros informed
me the donkey-boy had broken down; and when he
had brought in the animals to tie them up for the
night, that he had begun to cry and had said, "Where's
master? for I want something to eat." I was at my
wit's-end what to do, as it was two long days' march
to the nearest village, which was Azho, and I had
only just enough rice for one meal.</p>

<p>Things looked very bad; the evening closed in,
and, just before it got dark, Petros shouted out,
"Oh, here is the flour!" It was not our own flour,
it was a leading party of a caravan which was
going through to Walkait. This was indeed a
God-send! I saw there was no time to be lost,
so I called for my rifle, and the first donkey I
saw that looked as if it was loaded with flour I
seized, led to the camp, unloaded it, and poured out
the flour on the tarpaulin sheet which generally
formed the floor of our tent. The owner of the
donkey, as well as some of the rest of the caravan,
were, I believe, going to expostulate; but I told one
of my servants to tell them if they moved I would
shoot them, and that we were starving and we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
have food. At that moment the chief of the caravan&mdash;or
rather the man who is generally appointed to
lead these people through the country, and arrange
all payments to the customs&mdash;appeared. He made
everything all right, and we kept the flour; and, as he
rode away to the place where they were going to stop
that night, he sent me back, by one of my servants,
some bread of his own.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 26.</i>&mdash;I find in my journal this day that I was
very ill, and went out in the morning and shot two brace
of little sand-grouse, as I had not had fresh meat for
some little time. I did not take any more medicine, as
I found it made me so weak. I caused the servants to
make me a large "das," long and narrow; in one end I
used to sit most of the day, and in the other my guns
and what few provisions I had were hung up. They
watered the ground all round, and also the grass walls
of the "das," so that it made me pretty cool during the
heat of the day, whilst the darkness kept the flies out:
certainly it was rather miserable work feeling and
being ill all alone in the jungle; indeed long before
this I ought to have started for home, as, when once
dysentery gets hold of you, nothing but complete
change of air, good food, and medicine, is likely to
effect a cure. I still hung on to the thought that I
should get better, but, if I had known what was really
the matter, I should never have hesitated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p><i>Feb. 27.</i>&mdash;Our own flour did not appear till the
afternoon of to-day, and I never felt more pleased
than when I got it. They gave me a note from H.,
which was written in pencil on an envelope, and ran
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="address">
"Barrakee's Village, <i>Friday, 26th</i>, 1 <span class="s08">P.M.</span></p>

<p>"Thank Heaven we have just this moment arrived!
You never saw such a journey: it was sixty, if not
seventy, miles. We waited for two hours in the heat
of the day to rest the donkeys, and then went on as
hard as we could, and arrived at the river that Barrakee
had spoken about at 6 <span class="s08">P.M.</span> The rest of the donkeys
came up about an hour after. We stayed till the
moon got up about 11 or 12 <span class="s08">P.M.</span> We had to leave
the donkeys behind; they will, I hope, be here some
time to-night. I have been marching ever since, and
have just this moment arrived. The mules are regularly
done up: mine and Fisk's cannot move. I shall
keep the things <i>here</i> till you <i>come up</i>. You will find it
two good days' march from Coom-Coom-Dema to this
place. The river B. spoke about is a beastly place;
the water is bad, but you will be able to catch fish.
We caught some. Three of Barrakee's villagers are to
take the flour. I brought one of ours on, intending to
send him back, but it is impossible, for he is dead beat
and has been walking for twenty-four hours straight
off; he could never walk back sixty miles, for I quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
think it is that from Coom-Coom-Dema. You will see
when you come. They will show you the way here.
How is your complaint, old man? I do trust it is all
right now. I cannot move from here, for I know
when the baggage comes up the donkeys will be completely
done. They are bound to come on account of
the food.</p>

<p class="address">
"<i>Friday, Feb. 26</i>, 1.30 <span class="s08">P.M.</span></p>

<p>"They have just finished grinding and collecting
the flour. Our coolie is going after all. He is
anxious to make a dollar. If they are not with you
before sunset to-morrow (Saturday), they forfeit a
dollar. The money is with their Shum.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
 There is
enough for one hundred and sixty bread" (rations),
"also ten eggs. One of the bags that the flour is in
does not belong to us. We shall soon be all straight.
Barrakee is getting the rest of the flour."</p>

<p class="p2">Never was letter more acceptable, and especially as
with it had come the long-desired and looked-for
flour. Although H. had not long been away from
me, in the short time I had experienced a feeling of
loneliness as well as utter helplessness; but it was no
good giving way to thoughts like these, as if my servants
once saw any inclination on my part to despond,
I should never have been able to get anything done,
and they would have found out too soon that even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the much-dreaded white man is at times dependent
upon help, even if it be from a nigger. On the whole,
I cannot complain of my servants, as they had much
to put up with. When one is ill, little annoyances are
hard to bear, and I dare say at times I was thought
rather tyrannical; but it is very little use regretting
these things now, as there is not the remotest chance
of any of my natives reading what I have here written.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 28.</i>&mdash;This was an uneventful day, and I felt
exceedingly weak and ill. It had become very much
cooler than it was in the two camps nearer the
Tackazzee, as the north wind blows towards the
evening and the mornings are quite cool.</p>

<p><i>March 1.</i>&mdash;I find written in my journal: "Am, I
think, getting really better. I have shot one and a
half brace of little sand-grouse as they flew near the
tent in the morning. I went after the herd of hartebeest
that I had seen very often near the tent, on the
plain at the head of which I was encamped, but I
could not get near them. I succeeded to-day in very
nearly poisoning myself by mistaking one medicine
for another, for I took opium in mistake for some
other stuff. After I had discovered my error I swallowed
some brandy, went out for a walk, and told my
servants if they found me going to sleep to wake me
up."</p>

<p><i>March 2.</i>&mdash;The opium seems to have done me good,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
as I find written in the journal that "I am decidedly
better, the symptoms of dysentery having partly gone
away." To-day I had great fun shooting a fine bull
hartebeest. This animal is about the size of an
Alderney cow. I was going out of my tent very early
in the morning when I saw the herd grazing not far
off on the plain. I tried to stalk a bull which was
feeding behind the herd and on the nearest side to me,
but I failed. I then tried to stalk another, which was
more on the left of the herd, and which looked a very
big gentleman, and, I think, an old friend of mine, as I
had fired at him before. As I was creeping along, the
herd had closed up and passed not far off on my
right. The bull that I had first tried to stalk was following.
I missed him with both barrels of my
Express, and then I ran to the top of an ant-hill
and took aim at him with my heavy 12-bore rifle.
It was a very long shot; the left barrel broke his hind-leg
just at the hock; and now the hunt began.</p>

<p>I had come out of my tent with only my slippers on,
and in walking through the burnt grass of the plain
the short hard stubs were rather trying to my feet
with nothing but stockings on. The bull hartebeest
managed to go very nearly two miles; he stopped on
several occasions and let me come close up to him. I
fired at him with my Express, and, as I thought,
missed him; he then limped away again, but went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
a good deal faster than one would suppose was possible.
It was getting very hot, but I was determined
the brute should not beat me. I lost sight of him for
a little time among some trees; when I got through
them I found he was trying to ascend a small hill. I
had two more cartridges of my heavy rifle, and these
I fired at him, and as he was waddling up the hill
the shot broke the fetlock-joint of his other hind-leg.
This stopped him, and Goubasee and myself
found him sitting up like a dog, close to a white-ant
hill. I had no knife with me and no cartridges, and I
did not know on earth what to do; so Goubasee got
big stones and handed them up the ant-hill to me, as
I stood on the top and tried to smash his head in by
throwing them at him. He charged at me in a clumsy
way twice, when I was not on the ant-hill, and very
nearly caught me with his horns as I half tripped-up
in stepping back. I thought I would look in the cartridge-bag
to see if I had completely run out of
ammunition: to my great joy I found one Express
cartridge; so I put the beast out of his misery with
a shot behind the ear.</p>

<p>Guyndem, my other gunbearer, soon came up with
knives. The carcase was soon skinned and cut up,
and I sent back for two donkeys to carry the flesh
into camp; it made two heavy loads for the donkeys,
and the head and skin taxed the strength of the donkey-driver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
as he carried it home. I found that the
animal had been hit by three bullets; one of these was
a very curious shot: when I had fired at him with
the Express, and thought it was a miss, the bullet
had entered and exactly divided the hartebeest's tail
as he was galloping straight away from me. This
shot must have entered his entrails and stopped him
considerably; the two other bullets were the shots
that broke the hock of one of his hind-legs and the
fetlock-joint of the other. There was great rejoicing
amongst the servants and donkey-drivers, who had
abundance to eat; and three long strings of jerked
meat might be seen festooning the trees near camp.
They dried the meat on the leather thongs with which
the baggage was tied on the donkeys; these thongs
were stretched from tree to tree.</p>

<p>I returned to camp completely done up; and I do
not think the chase after the deer, under the hot sun,
did me very much good; but still a little sport, when
you have been ill for some time, cheers you very much.
I had been trying to make little snares to catch small
birds with, and especially the doves, that came down
in great quantities to drink at the water-pools. It
was rather amusing to watch them on these occasions,
but they were far too wary to be caught by
such clumsy contrivances.</p>

<p><i>March 3.</i>&mdash;Went out this morning to look for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
gazelles, of which there are generally two or three in
a little patch of very high grass that escaped the fire
at the time the rest of the dry grass was burnt. I
saw a buck gazelle and fired both barrels of the
Express, and missed. I then went and stood on an
ant-hill in the middle of the patch of high grass; two
does got up close under my feet and rushed away. I
fired both barrels, and missed. The gazelle is by
no means an easy thing to hit with a rifle when it
is going fast, as it is very small. I was rather
disgusted with this bad shooting, and was walking
back to camp when up rose another buck. I fired one
barrel, and missed; this shot seemed to turn him, and
he went away parallel to the direction I was going in,
offering a shoulder shot. I rolled him over with my
left barrel as he was cantering along; he gave two
or three convulsive bounds, and, when I got up to
him, he was quite dead; there is nothing like an
Express bullet for deadliness. Goubasee made a bag
of the skin, and I kept the head.</p>

<p>When I got back to camp I found that H. had sent
me some more provisions, and I also got a letter from
him, written on an envelope:&mdash;</p>

<p class="address">
"Barrakee's Village, <i>Sunday, February 28th</i>.</p>

<p>"The coolies have just come back. I am very glad
you got the flour from the caravan&mdash;that was first-rate;
but I am sorry you are not coming on yet. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
for this village, it is a horrid place, and there is nothing
to shoot within miles of it. It is up on a hill,
but is on the way to the Mareb; and so to-morrow I
am going to start with Fisk, Barrakee, Brou, and three
or four coolies. I shall leave some behind for you,
and they will bring you on; Barrakee is going to leave
a man to show you the way. I hope I shall have
better luck than on the Tackazzee. As for flour, I
cannot send you as much as I would, but still send a
good lot. We have hardly any empty bags. We sent
you three the other day; but when you get here have
them filled up, and come down. I send a bundle of
letters down, addressed to the consul at Suez&mdash;will
you see that one coolie, if not two, takes them down
to Massowah, to catch the steamer on the 24th of
March, as it only takes nine days at the outside to
get from Coom-Coom-Dema to Massowah. Do send
them for me to Arrekel Bey, and ask him to post
them. I send them to you, as I know you will have
some letters to send too. I have no ink or paper left.
This is the last&mdash;and I am writing to you now with
gunpowder and milk, which does capitally. I am
fearfully sorry about you, and should come back if I
thought I could do any good; but I know I really
could not. But I trust, old fellow, you will be all
right by the time you receive this. I shall not send
the flour off from here till daylight on Tuesday morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
or if I can I will arrange for it to leave on
Monday (to-morrow) evening. They are working hard
now, grinding a dollar's worth for us to take; and I
am sending you some honey, one bottle of brandy,
potatoes, onions, and some eggs. One donkey takes
the flour and two of our coolies.</p>

<p class="address">
"<i>Monday morning, March 1st.</i></p>

<p>"Your flour will leave this afternoon. Cassa here,
in charge of the baggage left behind. Shall be back
to-day fortnight; but they will show you the way
down when they come.</p>

<p class="left65">"Ever yours,<br />
<span class="i4">"H."</span></p>

<p class="p2">I must explain to my readers that the Mareb which
H. talks of in this letter is the same river that we
were on before, he being many miles lower down its
course, in fact, much nearer the plains than where we
had been.</p>

<p class="p2">A large caravan with cotton from Walkait came by
to-day. The chief of the caravan came up to me as I
was seated outside my "das" loading some cartridges,
and paid his respects, commencing by making two very
low bows&mdash;nearly touching the ground with his head.
I gave him some powder which he begged for, and
asked him if he would give me a <i>machet</i>, which is a
Tigré word for a little sickle, which the natives use to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
cut grass for their beasts; and my servants were always
complaining that they had not one, and so they could
not manage to cut grass well for the donkeys. He
was exceedingly civil and good-natured, and took one
of my coolies on with him some little way on the
road, to the place where they were going to camp,
and sent him back with the machet. The chief told
me they had seen elephants as they had come up from
the Tackazzee, and also three or four of the Baria
tribe. His people, very bravely&mdash;as they were ten to
one&mdash;offered to fight the Baria; but these niggers
were wise in their generation, and took to their heels
on seeing so large a party. The tail of the caravan
did not come up till nearly dark, and so camped for
the night about 150 yards from my tent. Just after
sunset, when I was going to eat my dinner, they
began a low-toned chant in which they all joined; it
was rather pretty and mournful. I asked Hadji
Mahomet, who was a Mahomedan, what it meant;
he said it was "church;" at least that was the interpretation
that Petros, my bearer, put upon his answer.
All these men who were singing were Abyssinian
Copts. I was much better in health this day.</p>

<p><i>March 4.</i>&mdash;Instead of staying quietly at Coom-Coom-Dema
I thought that a change of air to the
other side of the plain would do me good. I had
seen a spring of water on my way here, and so in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
morning I sent out one of my servants to look for it.
He came back and said he had found it; and so, in
the evening, just before sunset, I started for my new
camp. The servants were very annoying and they
would do nothing they were told. I fired much of the
dry grass of the plain, in hopes of burning the rest of it
bare in order that I might see more game, and I had a
long shot at a "tora," or hartebeest, on my way across.
When we got rather near the water where I was to
camp we happened to lose our way, and we were
wandering about for some time. Ali the cook possessed
a mule, on which the tin-pots and kettle were
strapped; the animal got frightened at the rattling of
the things on its back, and galloped away kicking and
plunging, sending the utensils flying in different directions,
including my two plates and a large boiling-pot
that I used to make soup in, and also Ali's bedding;
this, I am sure, he regretted a good deal more than
any of my things. He had bought this wretched
mule for 12 dollars at Adiaboo. This trip across made
me very ill, as all my arrangements went wrong, and
I did not get comfortably to bed until rather late.</p>

<p>Before I left Coom-Coom-Dema three wild-looking
men came into camp: they said they had come down
into the jungle to look for wild honey. They had a
small gourd filled with this stuff, for which they wanted
a dollar, and they were evidently very poor. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
gave me as a present two large pear-shaped fruit with
a green velvety shell; the inside was filled with seeds,
covered with a sort of white spongy pulp, which
was deliciously acid. The servants called this fruit
Habbaboo. I find Mansfield Parkyns says that this
fruit is called Dema, the scientific name being
<i>Adansonia digitata</i>. I gave these honey-hunters two
hanks of beads, with which they seemed very well
pleased.</p>

<p><i>March 5.</i>&mdash;I was not nearly so well this morning,
having drunk some brandy and water the night
before. The rice-water which I had been drinking
during my illness had been made at Coom-Coom-Dema
before I started, but it was in one of the tin-pots
that galloped off on the back of Ali's mule.
The servants again put me up a capital "das," and it
was very dark and cool. The cook's mule was found
to-day, but minus the stock-pot and some plates. I
informed him I would shoot the brute if he did not go
out and find the plates, etc., and wonderful to relate,
they appeared in the evening all right, but rather battered.
The mule had gone back to Coom-Coom-Dema,
and was found close to where we had before camped,
cropping the grass by the side of the water. I went
out in the evening and shot one of the little sand-grouse
for dinner as it came down to drink. I felt
very poorly, and almost too weak to walk about.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p><i>March 6.</i>&mdash;Worse to-day. This horrid complaint
sticks to me, symptoms of dysentery having returned.
I am afraid I must make up my mind to start for
home&mdash;a bad ending to a sporting expedition. I
shall have been ill now three weeks to-morrow. I
took some chlorodyne last night, and I think it only
made me worse.</p>

<p><i>March 7.</i>&mdash;I am much better this morning, having
taken three doses of opium, which acted instantaneously,
thank goodness! There was a thunder-storm
last night with two very heavy showers,
and the most beautiful sunset I ever saw; great
masses of clouds coming up from the south-east, and
vivid lightning, and the thunder rolling and echoing
through the mountains; it was a very grand sight.
I was kept awake part of last night by the howling of
a hyena, about ten yards from the tent. I thought
at first it was a lion, but the servants assured me it
was a <i>gib</i>, which is their word for hyena. He stopped
about a quarter of an hour, making a hideous noise,
and at last retired. There was a new moon to-day,
so I was in hopes there might be a change in the
weather, which would have done me much good: it
was a great deal cooler this morning, after the
thunder-storm. I made Goubasee administer a slight
castigation to Ali, the cook, who had neglected to
boil my rice-water the night before, and, as it was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
only thing I had to drink, this was very disagreeable,
as it was brought to me for my breakfast almost
boiling hot and excessively nasty. It is needless to
say this mistake never occurred again. This was not
his first offence, and Ali, who was a Cairo man, was
rather inclined at times to be sulky, and not to do
anything; but on the whole he was not a bad
servant.

</p>

<p><i>March 8.</i>&mdash;I was very bad all last night; I think I
had eaten too much meat at dinner. I am writing
my journal with a pen made out of a guinea-fowl
quill, and with ink composed of some gunpowder, preserved
milk and water, mixed up together&mdash;rather a
curious combination. My little camp bed is so small
that I asked Mahomet, my bearer, if he could make
me any sort of bed rather bigger. He said, "I make
bed Abyssinian fashion?" and I replied "Yes." He
set to work, with the help of Goubasee and Guyndem,
to make an <i>inchat algar</i>, which is their word for a
wooden bed. They cut four short forked poles and
stuck them upright in the ground; the holes they put
them into were grubbed out with the iron tent pegs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
They then tied sticks on to the four posts, so as to
make a sort of hollow oblong. These sticks were
tied with plaited bark or fibre. Inside, these oblong
sticks were lashed both to the foot and head of the
bed. Of course such a bed can be made of any
height and any length. They then cut a quantity of
dry grass and laid it across the frame, and my rugs
spread over the dry grass made an excellent, comfortable,
springy couch. I should think such beds would
be very good for impromptu hospitals on a campaign,
using hay or straw instead of grass; they are
exceedingly warm and well ventilated. It took
about two hours and a half for four servants to do the
whole thing; that is, for cutting the wood and grass,
grubbing the holes, tying the sticks, and completing it.</p>

<p>I have determined to start for home, as I get no
better here. I am indeed an unlucky sportsman, and
I always was. Perhaps it is all for the best. I do
not know what H. will say to this. I went out for a
little walk on the plain yesterday, and saw the herd
of hartebeest in the distance, but I did not feel up to
stalking them.</p>

<p><i>March 9.</i>&mdash;I am a little better to-day, and the provisions
I sent for to Barrakee's village have arrived all
safe; so I start for Azho, a large frontier village, to-day.
I hope to catch the steamer which I believe leaves
Massowah for Suez about the 24th of March. To-day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
I shot a large bare-necked vulture, which was hovering
over the camp last evening, and I am writing my
journal with one of its quills, as Petros, in sweeping out
my "das," chanced to lose my guinea-fowl pen. The
vulture I thought to be a bird of ill-omen, and so
knocked him down. In the evening I went out close to
the water and shot one of the sand-grouse which came
to drink, but it was so dark I could not find the bird.
No one can have any idea how miserable it is to be
sick in the bush, away from everybody and everything&mdash;no
one to speak to but your servant, who generally
talks the vilest of negro English. However, I was
homeward-bound to-day, my servants having made
me a rough sort of palanquin, in which I intended to be
carried, as I meant to try and avoid either walking or
riding. I hoped to get fresh eggs, milk, and chickens
at the village of Azho, which might improve me; as
in reality it was good food that I wanted. I had sent
on some of my baggage with Guyndem and another
servant, and with orders to build me a "das" at Azho,
and let the people know that I was coming. I proposed
to stop half-way on the road at Maidarou.</p>

<p><i>March 10.</i>&mdash;I had an awful journey on the previous
night. I started from the other side of the plain of
Coom-Coom-Dema at five o'clock by my little sundial,
and got to Maidarou, our old camping-place, about
9 <span class="s08">P.M.</span> Of course I could not say if this time was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
correct; it struck me as being a good deal later.
Taiou, one of our coolies&mdash;a man who had been with
an Englishman named Flood that had lived in the
country some time before&mdash;lost the donkey on which
my bed was strapped, just before we came into camp.
It was very dark when we came to Maidarou, and
Goubasee, who was carrying my palanquin, and who
was in front, tumbled into a hole and shot me
and my gun and books on to the ground. This was
rather unpleasant, considering the state of health I
was in, but there was no alternative but to get up and
laugh and go on. At last I saw the twinkling light of a
fire, and I soon found myself at the top of the little rocky
hill where we had camped before. But although I had
arrived at the halting-place there was no bed for me
to sleep on; so I bade them put all the skin bags I
had with me down at the end of the tent, then
I put some big stones alongside, and covered the
whole with some dry cut grass. This made a capital
bed, and I slept better than I had done for the last
two weeks, as I was completely tired and done up.
Curiously enough, the caravan that afforded me some
flour when my servants were almost starving had just
arrived, on their way back to Adiaboo with cotton from
Walkait. Zaroo, the man who behaved so kindly to
me before and gave me some bread of his own, said,
as I was so ill, he would induce some of the people of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
the caravan to carry me in my palanquin. I here
wrote my journal lying on my bags and straw under
the shade of two beautiful trees, a luxury one appreciates
in this hot climate. I am much better, I think,
to-day.</p>

<p>That afternoon I started for Azho; the chief of the
caravan, by threats and persuasions, making his people
carry me. I was jolted along somehow or other; and
the journey was not eventful, with one exception. One
old gentleman declined the honour of carrying me,
and made a great row. I found myself and my palanquin
placed on the ground, with every prospect of
being left there. I said, if they would not take me
on to the next camping-place I would shoot them, and
I let off my revolver in the air, but still the old native
refused to take up the burden, and told the other
people not to carry me. I here leaped up and knocked
him backwards with "one in the eye;" he tripped up
over his load of cotton, that he had placed down beside
him, and turned a complete summersault. The
rest, seeing what had become of him, and being rather
astonished at a sick man getting well enough to do
this, picked up me and my palanquin and carried
me off. It was getting late, and the men carrying me
were going very slow, so I rode the mule belonging to
Ali the cook, for a little way, but found I should not
be able to get to Azho that night, and I stopped at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
some water half-way. I was better, so I told the chief
I would not bother him or his people to carry me any
farther; and he came the last thing in the evening to
say good-bye to me, as they were going to start at
daybreak.</p>

<p>Last night Ali and Mahomet had a difference of
opinion about an order I had given with regard to
some food. One of them had told a lie, and they both
accused each other of lying. I said I could not
allow this, as nothing would be done if things went
on in this sort of way; so, in the morning, after the
caravan had gone on, I said they were to settle their
dispute with two sticks. I made Goubasee cut two
long sticks, and the scene which ensued beat anything
I ever saw. They were so frightened of each other
that neither of them dared at first to hit very hard,
but at length, when either of them did so, the other
flinched most dreadfully and then returned the blow
with compound interest. When one blow was harder
than another a yell in proportion followed its infliction.
I made myself quite ill with laughing at them,
and the servants were in convulsions too. At last they
begged of me to let them off; and so I said they
ought to be satisfied with each other now.</p>

<p><i>March 11.</i>&mdash;Started for Azho in the afternoon, riding
Ali's mule, and, after a tiring march, I came in sight
of the village at sunset. Some of the villagers, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
had heard I was coming up, came out to meet me and
say "How do you do?" I found that Guyndem, whom
I had sent on, had not built a "das," as the people
would not lend him any tools for making it, or give
him any assistance. I went straight up to a cluster of
houses, and said I should pitch my tent inside the
hedge which surrounded them. The people were very
civil at first, and brought some milk. I asked them to
give me some dry grass, which they used for thatching
their houses, to put on an <i>angareb</i> which they had lent
me.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
 I was in great pain at the time, and was very
much annoyed at their not bringing this grass, so I
sprang up with my revolver in my hand. Before
going any farther I must tell the reader that the adventure
which followed nearly cost me my life, and it
was all owing to my own foolishness. It is a great
mistake to flash your weapons if you really do not
mean to use them. I ran down among some houses
where my servants were talking trying to persuade
the people to give me some dried grass, and said if
they did not give me some I would shoot them. It
was getting rather dark, and I fired my revolver off in
the air. The women screamed, and in a minute
the whole village was up in arms. Some of the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
had spears, and the others guns: they completely surrounded
me, and one seized me by the wrist and
tried to drag me off. I snatched myself out of his
grasp and backed against a straw hut. Another man
kept pointing at me with a loaded gun about a foot
off my head, calling me <i>shifter</i>&mdash;which means robber.
At this moment a very tall Abyssinian pushed his
way through the crowd and came up to me, putting
his hand over his mouth, which was to give me to understand
that I was to hold my tongue and not make
a noise. He took me by the hand and led me away,
the crowd hooting and shouting at me. One fellow ran
in front and aimed his spear at me, but the tall Abyssinian,
who seemed to be my friend, raised his spear,
and the fellow took to his heels. As is very often the
case with most of these disputes, it all ended in smoke.
I got the straw for my bed after all, and went to sleep.
They came to me and told me I must take my tent
outside their village, but I replied that I would not
move it, and that it did no harm there; so it stopped
there for the night.</p>

<p><i>March 12.</i>&mdash;To-day I made Petros sit outside the
door of the big round Abyssinian hut that I had taken
possession of during the heat of the day and "make
bazaar," as he calls it; that is to say, he took my
handkerchiefs and beads and red cloth which I had
with me, and exchanged them for chickens and eggs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
of which I was in great need. It may interest some of
my readers to know what the rate of exchange was:
one Manchester cotton pocket-handkerchief for one
chicken and six eggs. The haggling and bargaining
over these important mercantile transactions was very
amusing, but Petros seemed up to everything; in fact,
his usual occupation was that of a merchant in the
bazaar at Suez. In the afternoon the man who had
pointed the gun at me and called me a robber came to
pay me a visit. I asked why he had called me a robber.
He said that when he heard the shot fired, the people
told him I had shot his brother. He had brought me
half a large pumpkin as a sort of peace-offering. I said
to him, if he would bring me a whole one I would give
him a red pocket-handkerchief. He went away and
fetched a large pumpkin, and I gave him a red handkerchief,
and then told him I was not accustomed to
be called a robber, and that, although I was very sick,
if he would get two thick sticks I would go outside
the village with him and give him an excellent
thrashing. My friend sneaked off at this, and another
Abyssinian, who was standing by, seemed much
amused. I had not got rid of the horrid complaint
that troubled me, and I was afraid that dysentery had
set in in earnest. I sent back a coolie from here to
H., with a letter to say that I had really started for
the coast. I heard no more of him till I got to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
England; the account of the sport he had I give
hereafter.</p>

<p>Towards the evening I started for Adikai, a village
we had camped in before. The man who had accused
me of shooting his brother and called me a
robber came to say good-bye to me, and we parted
the best of friends. I tried to find out who the tall
Abyssinian was who had helped me out of the
scrape and had taken me by the hand and led me
through the crowd, but he had disappeared, and no
one knew who or where he was; I believe he was
a king's soldier who was stationed here to collect
the customs. I had an easy march to Adikai, and
when I got to the village my servants told me that
Zaroo, my old friend the chief of the caravan, who
had made his people carry my palanquin, lived close
by. Shortly afterwards he came to see me, and
brought me some Dargousa beer, which had been
kept for some time and which was pretty good. I
was kept awake half the night by the barking of the
village curs: at last, at my entreaties, some ballagas
turned out and tried to stop them, but it was of no
use. A crying baby in a hut close by also enlivened
the night by its yells; so I sent to the mother of
the child and told her to give it some milk, which
seemed to quiet it.</p>

<p><i>March 13.</i>&mdash;The people of this village were much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
more civil to me, and one of two men who had behaved
very well at Azho, and who had come up with me,
sent off to a village close by and got me twelve eggs.
The Abyssinians, curiously enough, do not care for
eggs; they sometimes make a sort of curry of them
with red pepper. After this man brought me the
eggs, which was early in the morning, he went on to
Adiaboo, where it was market-day. Zaroo came to
me this morning, and I talked with him over my
journey to the coast, as he knew the road very well.
He told me he was acquainted with a much nearer
way to Koudoofellassie than that I had come by, and I
asked him if he would come with me to show it: at
first he said he would, and then he asked me what
I would give him. I only had five dollars with me,
so it was of very little use offering him that. I said I
would give him a revolver; but he told me this would
be of no use to him. What he really wanted was one
of my muzzle-loading pistols, of which I had a pair
of very good ones, which I had bought of Rigby in
St. James's Street, and which I particularly did not
want to part with. After haggling with him a long
time I was quite disappointed, as he had at first assured
me he did not want anything for showing me the
way. I then told him I would trust to myself and
go back the same way I had come, and thanked
him for his former kindness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>I sent on the donkeys with the tent to Maihumloo, a
little river where we had camped before, at the end of
the Sememmar Plain, meaning to go on in the afternoon.
I tried at this village to get two men to carry
some of my things, but they asked a great deal
too much, and so we could not come to terms. On
my way to Adiaboo, Goubasee stopped an old man,
and his wife and daughter, and asked the old gentleman
if he would help to carry the load Goubasee
had with him. The old patriarch asked where we
were going to; Goubasee replied Sememmar, and that
he would get a dollar if he carried the load; upon
which, without a moment's hesitation, notwithstanding
the entreaties of his wife and daughter, he picked up
the load and carried it along. His daughter then
began to cry, and said she would not leave him, so
they both joined our little party. This was a great
piece of luck for me, as it relieved Goubasee of a large
part of his load.</p>

<p>The market was just over as I passed through
Adiaboo. I tried to find some man to guide me
the short way of which Zaroo had told me, but
none of them would go, as they said it was a bad
road, the stages were long, and there was very
little water. While I was talking to these people a
young man came up and said that he had letters
for Rass Mayo, which was the name I went by in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Abyssinia; upon which my servants told him he was
to give them to me immediately. This was the man
that the head of the Mahomedan village had sent off
with my letters. He had sent them by the steamer
and had brought me back letters from home. I was
delighted to get them, and for the rest of my march
across the large plain which lies between Adiaboo
and Sememmar I occupied myself in reading the good
news from home. I had miscalculated the distance
from Adiaboo to Maihumloo; it was a great deal too
far, and we had started late, having been delayed in
the market-place. I was getting more and more exhausted,
and it was rapidly becoming dark. Just as
night closed in a thunder-storm came on, Goubasee,
who had been our guide, completely lost his way, and I
was dreadfully ill and weary, so we had to stop in the
middle of the jungle. I managed with great difficulty
to light a fire, and make a little soup out of
Liebig's extract of meat. The poor girl that had
accompanied her father, who was carrying some of
my baggage, had sprained her ankle, or sustained
a similar injury, and it was a miserable sight to see
her sitting shivering over the fire and crying piteously
with pain. I also suffered very much from illness
all night.</p>

<p><i>March 14.</i>&mdash;At last morning came, and I determined
to move on to Maihumloo the first thing, in hopes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
of finding the donkeys with the tent and some food.
Some travellers came by, whom my servants rushed
at and despoiled of some of the bread they had with
them; thus at any rate my retinue ate some breakfast.
I stopped at some houses, which were only a very
short way from the place where we had lain out for
the night, but during and after the thunder-storm it
had been so dark that we could not see around us.
The inhabitants of these huts gave me some eggs,
which provided material for my breakfast. When I
got to Maihumloo there was no sign of either tent or
donkeys, which had gone on before us, so I stayed in
the dry bed of a watercourse that was very pleasantly
shaded over. I succeeded in making a fire and
cooking my eggs for breakfast, and sent Goubasee off
to look for the donkeys. He seemed to think that
they had gone on in front of us to the village of
Sememmar, so he went up there to look for them, and
returned without having found them; but shortly
afterwards they all appeared. Hadji Mahomet, who
had charge of them, had taken good care not to
sleep out in the jungle like ourselves, but had halted
in a village not far off and stayed there for the
night. I sent them on, in the afternoon, to Sememmar,
and from thence they were to go on to Zadawalka.</p>

<p>After the heat of the day, and when I had rested
myself by lying in the shade, I started after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
tent and donkeys. I called at the house of the
chicker of the village of Sememmar, told him who I
was, and said that I wanted some chickens and eggs;
he was very civil, and gave them to me at once
without any palaver. I asked him if he knew of any
news in the country, and I was told that they had
heard that Mimleck, the king of Shoa, with whom
the king of Abyssinia was at war, had fought and
beaten Johannes, the king: I heard afterwards there
was no truth in this. Again I travelled on, and, after
having passed the place where the market of Sememmar
is held, I came upon Hadji Mahomet and the
donkeys, with the tent pitched and everything ready.
He told me it would be impossible to go on to Zadawalka
that day, so I resolved to stop here, as
everything was comfortable and there was plenty to
eat. Our encampment was just below a pretty little
Abyssinian church, which was surrounded by large
Qualqual trees. Most of the churches here are built
in little groves of these queer-shaped trees.</p>

<p><i>March 15.</i>&mdash;I went to bed shortly after I got into
camp last night, and this morning I found myself
better, yet still very ill. I think I must have lost at
least a stone in weight, having become dreadfully thin.
It was very pleasant to wake up and find oneself in a
comfortable little camp-bed, instead of being chilled
and cold lying by the half-consumed sticks of a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
camp fire, my experience of the previous day. Two
donkeys were completely worn out, so the servants
recommended me to sell them here for what I could
get. Some of the villagers standing near were informed
that I had donkeys for sale; we had a short bargain
over the matter, and at last the two went for four
dollars. My fortune, that was to last me until I got
to Massowah, where 100<i>l.</i> was awaiting me, now consisted
of seven dollars, and, as my readers will see
later, I experienced great inconvenience in consequence
of not having more money with me.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, having first started the remaining
donkeys in front, I went up to the village of Zadawalka.
It was a long march, but very pleasant and
cool, the day being cloudy, and the country we were
travelling through furnished a succession of beautiful
scenes. There was a heavy thunder-shower in the
middle of the day, which soaked us through. On the
way I had a shot with my Express at a jackal which
crossed the path, but I could not succeed in hitting so
small an animal with a bullet. Just after the rain
had ceased, we crossed a small stream; Goubasee,
who was in front of me, suddenly stopped, and I saw
swimming slowly up the little river two fine geese.
I jumped off my mule, got my 16-bore gun, fired,
and killed the gander. A cartridge which had some
time previously stuck in one of the barrels of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
gun obliged me to load again, and after my first
shot the goose only flew a short way up the river and
dropped, when I bagged her too. These were two
lucky shots, as they provided me with fresh meat, of
which I stood in great need. Not long before I arrived
at the village of Zadawalka I saw five enormous
hornbills feeding in a field close to the path. They
are called in Abyssinia Aba Gouma. They were an
unusual sight stalking about in different directions,
and picking up what insects and beetles they could
find.</p>

<p>When I got to Zadawalka I rode up at once to the
Shum's house. I went in and introduced myself, and
said I wanted bread and lodging for our party that
night. By way of putting ourselves on a pleasant
footing with our new hosts, my followers, who I am
sorry to say had now become rather a rough set,
seeing a jar of beer standing close by, immediately
seized it, handed it round, and the thirsty souls
swallowed the beverage almost before the rightful
owner had time to look about. The people of the
house assured me I could not stop there that night,
but said they would provide me with a house a
little way off. I made them swear by the king's
death, Johannesee Mut, which is the form of oath
in Abyssinia, that they would do what they promised.
The donkeys and tent did not appear, so I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
had to sleep in an Abyssinian hut, where I could
see the moon shining through the roof, and insects
and creeping things paid me unwelcome visits. The
door of this hut was so low that entrance had to be
effected on the hands and knees. Notwithstanding
all these little inconveniences, I managed to sleep
pretty well, after a good dinner made of the two
geese's livers, which were both large and excellent, and
brought to mind <i>pâté de foie gras</i>&mdash;without truffles.</p>

<p><i>March 16.</i>&mdash;This morning I was not troubled with
the very violent pain which I usually experienced,
and altogether I felt in better condition. I asked the
chief of the village if he could give me two coolies to
guide our party as far as Gundet, as I proposed
adopting a new and shorter route, which would save a
day's march. He at length found two men, who for
two dollars each were to go with me; one dollar each
I had to pay before they started, and the balance was
to be given them on arrival. The villagers brought
up plenty of fresh eggs for breakfast&mdash;they were the
only things which really seemed to agree with me.
A great crowd of Abyssinians watched me as I
got up in the morning and performed my toilet:
what seemed to excite their attention most was the
operation of washing my teeth with a tooth-brush
and some charcoal. They could not make out what
I could possibly be doing, as their mode of cleaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
their teeth is by chewing a stick and rubbing their
grinders with the frayed end. About eleven o'clock I
started for Adavartee. This village is only one day's
march from Adowa; in fact, from Adavartee you
can see the peculiarly-shaped conical-pointed hill
which marks the neighbourhood of the Abyssinian
capital. Before reaching Adavartee I stopped at a
house on the road which was tenanted by very civil
people, who brought my servants beer to drink. Petros
cooked some eggs and bacon for my lunch, after
which we rested a little while and then went on. We
were unable to reach Adavartee at all, but were
obliged to stop at a village called Adoqual. The
donkeys, with the tent, came up just before it was
dark, and, instead of my having to sleep in the village,
I moved to the tent outside, and slept comfortably
there. The geese were roasted for dinner, and proved
capital food.

</p>

<p><i>March 17.</i>&mdash;I occupied myself this morning in
cleaning up my guns and pistols, which had not been
looked at for the last three or four days. This was a
long, tiring affair, but I recommend all who are
similarly circumstanced to look to their fire-arms
themselves, unless they have a trustworthy European
servant with them, as natives always manage to do
everything contrariwise, and spoil the very best
weapons. I was now much better in health, but
still I suffered from bad diarrh&oelig;a. I started for
Gundet late in the afternoon; the consequence being
that, as it was a long march, we lost our way.
Petros and Guyndem, whom I had sent up to some
villages to try to get eggs or chickens for my dinner
that night, happened to lose us completely, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
were crossing the valley of the Mareb through a
thick jungle. We crossed the dry bed of the river near
which, only much lower down, we had previously encamped;
darkness came on as we pushed through the
jungle, and we were overtaken by a thunder-storm in
the same way we had been before, and we were compelled
to halt, as it had become pitch dark. We
succeeded in lighting a fire, but I had literally nothing
to eat, as Petros was carrying the few provisions of
which I was possessed; the only thing in the shape of
food that I had was a bag of corn for my mule. I
made Goubasee roast some corn in the camp fire;
this he picked out of the ashes, and it constituted my
dinner. These hardships would have been bad enough
to bear if I had been well, but in my weak state of
health they were very trying. I was terribly ill all
night, and very cold, as I had nothing to cover me but
a cotton shama which I had bought for a dollar at the
village of Zadawalka, and, in the morning, I was
scarcely able to move. Another night like this would,
I think, have finished me, and my tale would have
been unwritten.</p>

<p><i>March 18.</i>&mdash;When daylight dawned my servants
went up to some houses, which, although close by, in
the darkness we had not been able to see. Petros and
Guyndem appeared the first thing this morning, having
passed the night in the valley of the Mareb, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
jungle; Petros assured me he slept very little, as he
was afraid the lions would eat him. The natives, who
had heard I was ill, very kindly brought some milk
and eggs. We were close to a village called Aila
Mareb, and I determined, after about an hour or so,
to push on to Gundet, so as to complete the march
that I had intended to do the day before. I was so
bad I could scarcely sit on my mule, but at length we
arrived at Gundet. I lay here under a tree for most
of the day, completely exhausted and worn out, and
I managed to get a little sleep. During most of the
day the tree which I was under was surrounded by
great numbers of cattle, which seemed to think I
was occupying their favourite resting-place: there was
water close by. They were remarkably fine beasts
for this part of the world, and I should think at least
a thousand head passed by the place where I was
lying. A little short Abyssinian came and squatted
down close by me; he seemed inclined to converse,
so I sent for Petros, and we held a long conversation
on different subjects, which ended by my inducing
him to go for some preparation which is called Shirou,
and is made from a bean pounded up with red pepper.
The Abyssinians eat this as a sort of relish with their
bread or meat. I do not suppose it was the best thing
I could have eaten, but still I had a fancy for it, as
in illness one often has for some questionable dainty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>While I was lying under the tree a rather nicely-dressed
Abyssinian came up, followed by a couple of
loaded mules and two servants. Petros rushed up to
him and embraced him. I asked who he was, and
Petros replied, "It is my brother, whom I have not
seen for many years." I believe, in reality, it was his
step-brother. He was a merchant, who had come
from the Shoa country, and was going down to
Massowah with musk and gold.</p>

<p>Since writing the above there has taken place in
this very spot, Gundet, a very severe battle between
the Egyptians and Abyssinians, and I cannot help
thinking that it was owing to the nature and conformation
of the ground that the forces of Egypt,
2000 in number, were so completely overwhelmed
and destroyed by their enemies. Before reaching
Gundet, that is to say, on the road from Massowah,
the country is all flat table-land, when suddenly the
ground drops, and Gundet lies in a narrow valley,
with high cliffs on each side of it. An army marching
right down into this defile would easily be surrounded,
and its retreat cut off. Probably the Abyssinians
let the Egyptians descend the steep hill, and
then encountered them, when the only thing remaining
for the invaders to do was to fight it out to the
last. But it seems incredible to me that a force of
2000 should march right into the jaws of an enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
without seemingly having the least intimation of their
being near. The Abyssinians are stated to have
mustered 30,000 strong, and I am sure my old friend
Kirkham would have taken every advantage of the
locality and the ground. The hatred of the Abyssinians
to the Turk, as they call the Egyptians, was in
this case very well exemplified, as nearly every one
of the latter was killed, and among them Arrekel Bey,
whose loss, as a kind friend, I very much deplore and
lament, for nobody could have been more civil and
courteous than he was when we were at Massowah.</p>

<p>I cannot help here quoting a letter of mine, dated
May 7th, 1875, published in the 'Pall Mall Gazette'
shortly after my arrival in England. At the end of
the letter I state what I thought would happen if
Egyptians and Abyssinians came in conflict in the
country of the latter, and it turns out my prognostication
has not been falsified by events:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"Having only just returned to England from travelling
in Abyssinia, I happened to see a letter copied
from the 'Cologne Gazette,' and commented on in
your paper of the 13th of April last. The correspondent
of the 'Cologne Gazette' must be misinformed,
I think, on some of the subjects he writes
about. First, the writer designates King Johannes,
the king of Abyssinia, 'as but a poor actor by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
side of a real hero,' i.e., comparing him with Theodore,
the late king. King Johannes has totally subjugated
his country and the rebels that were in it. The people
cultivate their land in peace, and tranquillity prevails.
As for his subjects being in a state of chronic rebellion,
it is not the case; let any one who doubts this
travel through the country, and judge for himself.
Secondly, the 'Cologne Gazette' says, with regard to
Colonel Kirkham, 'that all his attempts to improve
the country have failed.' Now, as every one knows,
with nothing, nothing can be done. Colonel Kirkham
was living with me for a month, and has often told
me the first thing to be done in Abyssinia is to make
and improve the roads. He has often tried to persuade
King Johannes to do this, but the king will not
spend a farthing and keeps his money hoarded up.
Thirdly, with regard to the missionaries at Gindar,
it is so far true that General Kirkham, to whom
Gindar has been given by the king, allowed the missionaries
to build a house there. I never heard anything
of the Abyssinians threatening to kill the missionaries
and burn their houses. I passed through
Gindar myself on the 25th of March last; the missionaries'
house was standing still, but the missionaries had
left, one of their number having died of fever after the
rains, so they moved to a healthier place. Fourthly,
the article now ends by saying that 'a struggle of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
undisciplined and badly-armed Abyssinians with
Egyptian troops would be hopeless.' Now, the Egyptians
would have to fight through mountain passes
and hills&mdash;a warfare well suited to Abyssinian tactics,
and not one that Egyptian troops would either appreciate
or well understand. The Abyssinians are just
as well armed as the Afghans were when we fought
against them on the frontiers of India. The name of
the Turk is hated in Abyssinia, and used as an
epithet of opprobrium."</p>

<p class="p2">In the afternoon I started on the road to Adgousmou,
and climbed the abruptly steep hill at
the top of which, if my readers remember, Borum
Braswouldeselassie took leave of us. The table-land
on which I found myself is called Serai, and
is celebrated for its fertility. I travelled on, and
stopped by some water, a little way beyond the
village of Adwahla. The servants were rather annoyed
at stopping away from the village, as there
was not any shelter near, and I had only just erected
the tent when a fearful thunder-storm came down on
us; luckily, my bed and things were inside, and so
everything was all dry, but the wretched servants got
wet through and through, and it was with great
difficulty that Ali kindled a fire with cattle-dung for
fuel, as no sticks or wood could be got anywhere near.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p><i>March 19.</i>&mdash;This morning Goubasee was laid up with
a bad leg, which I thought proceeded from rheumatism
combined with hard work. I hoped he would not
break down altogether, as he was an excellent servant,
and he had been of the greatest use to me. I sent
Guyndem, my other gun-bearer, up to the neighbouring
village, and some villagers very kindly brought
brown bread and milk, for myself and my followers.
This was very hospitable of them, as, on most occasions,
villagers took no notice of messages brought by
one's Abyssinian servants, and it was very often with
great difficulty we got provisions even by applying in
person. To-day several caravans passed the camp on
their way down to the coast. These caravans are just
beginning to travel; but it is during the rains that
most of them go through the country, so as to arrive
at Massowah in June or July, at the time it is
hottest on the coast, and when most of the business
is transacted.</p>

<p>I started after breakfast for Koudoofellassie, and
arrived at nightfall at the door of Borum Bras.'s
house; I found himself and household all at dinner.
This was a time of fasting with the Abyssinians, when
they do not eat during the day, but only after sunset.
I had sent on word by a native, who said he was going
to Koudoofellassie, to tell Borum Bras. that I was
coming, but evidently the man had not delivered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
message, and I was not in the least expected. But it
seemed that I was no unwelcome guest, for directly
one of the servants saw me he went in and told Borum
Bras. I had arrived. I was led in by the hand, and
was truly glad to see this Abyssinian chief, as he had
been very kind and hospitable to us on our way to
the Tackazzee, and I hoped he might help me to get
to the coast. After they had finished their dinner, he
sent away his household, and had a fire lighted for me
inside the hut. I was wet through, cold as well as
ill, and was very glad of the warmth. I told Borum
Bras. all that happened, how unlucky I had been, and
that now I was on my way home on account of illness.
He was exceedingly civil and kind, and asked what he
could prepare for me for my dinner. Out of beans
his wife made me a sort of cake, which was very good,
and he also gave me some "tej." My donkeys, with
the tent, etc., came up later, but I resolved to sleep in
the hut in which I was. I accordingly turned in, but
it was of no use trying to get any rest, as the hut in
which I reposed was, as a rule, not only used as a
dining-room but also as a stable, and the horses
munching their food during the night kept me awake.
Sundry small animals of the insect tribe seemed to
like the taste of the blood of a white man; it might
have been a change for them; it certainly was a
change for me, and, in my already weak state, unbearable;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
so, about one o'clock in the morning, I made my
servants get up and pitch my tent, and there I went
to bed, and slept well the rest of the night.</p>

<p><i>March 20.</i>&mdash;This morning Borum Bras. got me a
messenger, and I sent down letters to the French
Consul, as well as to the Governor of Massowah,
telling the latter that I was ill, very likely to be a day
or two late for the steamer, and begging of him to
keep the boat waiting for me, if possible. Whilst I
was taking my breakfast, and whilst Borum Bras. was
talking to me and inquiring after my general health,
there was suddenly a shout, the chief started up and
rushed off to his house close by. All the people of the
town ran to their houses and armed themselves, and
the women stood on the tops of the houses screeching
their peculiar cry to call out the men. The cause of the
commotion was that a robber, who lived near this district,
had attacked an outlying village, and had carried
off some cows and killed a man. All the inhabitants
turned out and formed themselves in battle array in
two lines outside the town. The mode in which Abyssinians
go to fight is rather a curious one: the men
that are lucky enough to possess guns are placed in
the front rank in one long line, and behind them are
those that have only spears and shields&mdash;this line
is generally three or four deep. I caused my mule to
be saddled, took my gun, and rode out to see if there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
was any chance of a fight taking place. It was very
amusing to see a little fellow strutting up and down
opposite this armed rabble and haranguing them,
calling upon them to fight well and to follow Borum
Bras. their chief; telling them, in so many words, they
were the bravest of the brave, and there were no
heroes in the world like them. Then something like a
word of command was given, and the whole of the men
moved forward a little, shouting and yelling, then they
squatted down again. I asked if there was any chance
of seeing this robber, or of his coming here. An old
Mahomedan, who seemed wiser than the rest, informed
me that there was not the slightest likelihood of his
coming to attack Koudoofellassie, as the people were
much too numerous. I went back to camp and got
my things packed up, as I intended to march to
Terramnee that day.</p>

<p>When all was ready I started off, and found that
the army of Koudoofellassie had moved some little
way outside the town. Borum Bras. and his attendants,
on horseback, might be seen in the distance
going through a variety of extraordinary evolutions,
galloping hither and thither, making a pretence of
spearing people. When I came up to the crowd I
found the women of the village were going about
with large jars of water to quench the thirst of their
husbands and relatives, and some of them had brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
out food; they were evidently going to make a day
of it. I took leave of Borum Bras. with much regret;
he rode a little way on the road with me, and then
we parted. I arrived at Terramnee shortly before
sunset, sent for Tuckloo, a former acquaintance of
mine and the chicker of the village, and asked for
some eggs for my dinner. He brought me a few
rotten eggs, which I had much pleasure in smashing
on the stones before him to prove their condition;
he then went back and obtained some fresh ones. I
made myself an omelette; and my donkeys, with the
bedding, etc., having come up, I had my tent pitched
a little distance outside the village.</p>

<p><i>March 21.</i>&mdash;This morning I received a visit from
one of Borum Bras.'s servants, whom he had started
off very early to inquire after me and see how I was
getting on. This was very kind of him; and this man
also ordered the chicker to give me what eggs, etc.,
I wanted, and then left the village. After he had
gone, this same chicker seemed to think it quite
unnecessary to take any notice of me, and I received
no provisions; so, as a flock of goats was passing
by my tent, I took the liberty of catching a kid,
tender and young, and handed it over to Ali to
cook, who soon cut its throat, and kid cutlets were
very shortly frying in the pan for my breakfast. I had
hardly eaten the last of them when the owner of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
goats came up and made a great noise, saying he
must be paid. I told him I had not the slightest intention
of paying him anything, as he had been ordered
to supply me with food, and a young kid was very
little out of a large flock. Eventually the affair was
settled, and it was agreed the villagers should bear
the loss of the kid between them. The meat was a
great change for me, as I had been living mostly on
eggs and chickens for the last week. I started about
mid-day for Deevaroua. It was very hot crossing the
plain which lay between this village and Terramnee.
I went past Deevaroua and halted for a short time
below it, under the shade of a large tree that grew
by the bank of the Mareb, which is here quite a little
stream. I tried to get two natives to carry some of my
things down to Massowah, but they refused to do so
unless they were paid in advance. I assured them I
had plenty money at Massowah, but they would not
believe me, and I had not enough coin with me to pay
them.</p>

<p>I do not think I was ever so much annoyed in my
life as I was on this occasion with these two men. I
felt inclined to give them both a thrashing; but it is
very lucky I restrained my temper as, otherwise, it is
very likely I should have had the whole village down
upon me, and perhaps would not have got so well out
of it as I did out of my last scrape. One certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
does feel very helpless without money, no matter
where one finds oneself, and this fact, combined with
my prostrate condition (of which, no doubt, these
men knew as well as I did), rendered me incapable of
much exertion. So I had to make up my mind to
get my already rather weary servants to carry the
things; and the proverb, "Money makes the mare
to go," came bitterly home to me.</p>

<p>After resting myself, I rode towards the village of
Chickut, which was, my readers will remember, the
scene of my night march on our way to the Tackazzee.
The country through which I passed presented a
beautiful appearance&mdash;one continual grove of wild
olive-trees, and great Qualquals dotted here and there.
This part was not at all cultivated, yet I should
think that these olives, if properly trained and cared-for,
would make a valuable property; but the natives
of Abyssinia have no idea of making oil from the
berries. This place is only four days from the coast,
and transport of the oil, when made, would not be very
expensive. I was very ill all the day, and in the afternoon
was so bad that I had to get off my mule and
rest under a tree. When I arrived at Chickut I pitched
my tent close to a little Coptic church. The village is
built on a high hill, and the houses are not like those
in the other part of Abyssinia through which I had
been travelling; they were flat-roofed, and the walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
were built with stones, whereas the ordinary form of
huts was a round wall with an extinguisher-shaped
roof. It was very cold here, and directly the tent
was pitched and my bed made ready I turned into it,
and caused my dinner to be brought to me as I lay
between the blankets. I find this entry in my journal:
"I am not worse, but still very ill. Thank God, I am
getting near the end of this awful journey! The
chicker here was very kind, and gave my servants
abundance of bread for themselves and a chicken for
me."</p>

<p><i>March 22</i>: <i>Chickut.</i>&mdash;The people here are all busy
putting a roof on the little Coptic church, close by
which I had encamped, and the work is done amidst
much chattering and talking. I heard from some merchants
yesterday that Arrekel Bey, the Governor,
had come back to Massowah; so I hope, if this is
true, he will keep the steamer for me if I am late.
I sent on some of my servants to Beatmohar, K.'s
house, to-day, to let his boy Waldemariam know
that I was coming, so as to make everything ready
for me. Hadji Mahomet was behind with the rest of
my donkeys, and I was afraid they would not arrive
at Massowah in time to catch the steamer. I started
in the afternoon and climbed the steep hill which
lies between Chickut and the table-land of Asmarra.
It was a lovely view as we ascended, and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
even more charming in the daytime than it had
looked in the light of a tropical moon, the condition
under which we last saw it. I passed by Sellaadarou,
the place where we had encamped, and saw the remaining
marks of the two large bonfires we had made.
After leaving this place I met some natives on the
road; one of them was carrying in his hand a club
made of the wild olive wood: it was a beautifully-shaped
weapon, and I induced him, after great persuasion,
to sell it to me for a dollar. He would not
hear of parting with it at first, but some of his companions
told him he was a great fool not to sell it,
as he could get many others, and a dollar was a good
price for the stick.</p>

<p>Travelling on, I found myself on the large plain
of Asmarra. Notwithstanding the precautions the
people had taken the cattle disease had got among
their beasts, and I saw several lying down, stretched
out, dying by the side of the pools. The wind
blew cold as I crossed the plain, and I wrapped
the cotton shama that I had tightly round me.
We were a small and wretched-looking party, as
we wound our way slowly across this bare tableland;
the hardships and long journeys had told
pretty severely upon all of us. I thought the plain
would never cease, and K.'s little house, with the
extinguisher-shaped roof, rose up in the distance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
but seemed to get farther from me. To my astonishment,
among some stunted bushes I saw two gazelles
grazing. I alighted and successfully stalked one, but
missed him as he bounded away. I was too weak
and ill for shooting, so I mounted my mule again
and soon found myself under the welcome shelter
of K.'s little house. Waldemariam had got everything
ready for me, and some fresh baked bread,
which was a great luxury. We had left a box of
provisions behind here, which I immediately broke
into, and to my great joy I found two bottles of
claret and other provisions which we had brought up
here. I made my dinner of fresh bread, fried sardines,
and a bottle of claret&mdash;just about the very worst
diet I could have taken under the circumstances;
the consequence being that I was terribly ill all
night.</p>

<p><i>March 23.</i>&mdash;About four in the morning I heard a
cry outside in the village, and then a wailing and
lamentation, mixed up with donkeys braying and
cocks crowing. It transpired that an old man, who
had been ill for some time, had just died. This
was an unpleasant thing to happen, and was not
calculated to raise my spirits under the circumstances
in which I was placed. Later in the morning a
brother of Naib Abdul Kerim came to see me. The
Naib was the man who brought us up here, and who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
arranged for the transport of our luggage on bullocks
and mules. His brother asked me if he could be of
any use, as he had heard I was ill; it was very
kind of him, and he proved of great service. I told
him that I should be very much obliged if he could
get me men from the village to carry me down to
the coast, for I was now becoming so extremely weak
that I really thought another two days' riding would
have polished me off. Accordingly he went into the
village and obtained twelve or fourteen men. I borrowed
a large angareb from one of the villagers,
and caused them to fix two long poles to it, so that it
could be carried on men's shoulders. I had no money
with me, but luckily K. had left behind a sum of
money, and I took the liberty of borrowing some
dollars from him to pay the coolies, as these people
always insist upon half the agreed sum being paid in
advance. I sent forward letters to the French Consul
and the Governor, again asking them, in case I should
be late, to keep the steamer waiting for me.</p>

<p>On Saturday, about four o'clock in the morning, I
was carried very comfortably down to Maihenzee, our
old camping-place, where we had passed such a wet
night on our way up here; I now passed a comfortable
night and felt better. Naib Abdul Kerim's
brother brought some coffee with him, of which he
gave me a portion, which I think improved me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>The manner of making coffee is rather peculiar,
and merits description. When on the march, and
travelling in Abyssinia, the natives carry a bag of
unroasted berries; taking a few of the grains out of
the bag, they put them on a little mat, and then
scrape some hot wood-ashes out of the fire; these
they mix with the coffee-grains, and then shaking
the mat up and down, much in the same way as one
sees a groom shaking a sieve of oats to get the dust
from them, the coffee becomes gradually roasted. I
believe that they know when it is sufficiently done
by the smell. Then the coffee is put between two
stones and ground to powder; or, if they happen to
have a small pestle and mortar, that is used. The
ground coffee is then put into a little earthenware
vase&mdash;one can hardly call it a jar as it has a long
neck&mdash;water is poured into the vessel, which is put to
boil on the fire. When sufficiently heated, some
fibre is crammed in the mouth of it to prevent the
coffee-grounds from coming out into the cup; then
some of those little Turkish cups are produced, and
the coffee poured out and drunk. Drinking coffee in
these regions is quite a little ceremony, and is generally
the time when the most important affairs are
discussed, and compliments are exchanged. I may
as well say that some of the best coffee I have ever
tasted was made in the way described. Why is it so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
hard to get good coffee in England? One great
secret, I am sure, is that every time it is made the
berries ought to be fresh roasted and fresh ground.</p>

<p><i>March 24.</i>&mdash;This morning I enjoyed the luxury of
a really good wash in hot water, in my little tin basin,
having found some soap in K.'s house. I had been
without soap for several days, and I was disgusted to
find that specimens of the entomology which infests
Abyssinians and their houses had transferred their
attentions to myself. I hope that none of my readers
will ever have to experience, especially in a hot country,
the total inability of washing oneself properly.</p>

<p>If there is one thing that is pleasant, and I may say
almost a luxury, it is the power of having a really good
wash. When one is leading a rough life, one misses
the morning tub of civilized life. Even on reaching
the Tackazzee, the waters of the river looked inviting
for a swim; an indulgence in this pastime would be
made in the face of the fact of there being a chance,
and indeed a very good one, of being snapped up by
a crocodile, which would have been an unpleasant
and abrupt termination to a trip undertaken from
motives of pleasure and sport. The only place where
bathing was practicable was the shallow ford, and
during most of the day our native servants might
have been seen paddling and splashing about in the
shallow water, much to their delight and amusement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
I am sure it did them all a great deal of good, Abyssinians,
as a rule, not being fond of water applied
externally. The not very delicious odour experienced
on going amongst them is a sufficient guarantee of
this statement.</p>

<p>Whilst I was sitting outside my tent an Armenian
merchant, who, my servants told me, went by the
name of Bogos, passed by with several mule loads of
ivory; he had come from the Shoa country, and he
was one of the best-looking men whom I had ever
seen; very fair, at least in comparison with Abyssinians,
and dressed in the costume of the country.
He informed me that the steamer was expected to-day,
which was its proper day; and I hoped to arrive
in time for it, as, if I could stand the journey, I should
be at Massowah to-morrow. I had found an old
copy of Milton in K.'s house, and so I passed the
morning in reading 'Comus,' which I enjoyed very
much.</p>

<p>I left Maihenzee about mid-day. It was very
curious to observe the change in the vegetation at
the top of the pass; the coast rains had ceased on
the side nearest Massowah, and everything on that
side was green and beautiful, whilst in the part I had
just traversed the ground was completely dried up,
and bushes and trees were bare. I stopped at
Mehdet and procured something to eat, then I travelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
on and got to Gindar about 8 <span class="s08">P.M.</span>, feeling very tired
and ill, although the men had carried me well. I sent
for Aristides, the Greek, who was still here building a
house. He was very glad to see me, and he told me
in broken French that I looked very ill, and that he
would accompany me next day into Massowah.
K., to whom Gindar belongs, had presented me
with some land&mdash;the whole side of a mountain, and
a small hill in the valley; and I engaged Aristides
to build me a small house, so if I should go to Abyssinia
again I shall have a place to live in. In
exchange for this land which K. gave me, I promised
to send him out a box-full of the seeds of all our
English vegetables.</p>

<p><i>March 25</i>: <i>Gindar.</i>&mdash;This little valley is looking
very beautiful, all the vegetation green and sprouting,
and the grass up to one's knees; the whole air is
alive with bees and insects in quest of honey from
the flowers.</p>

<p>How changed was everything since the last time I
was here! In my former visits I was full of hopeful
expectation, looking forward to pleasant adventures
and good sport; and now I was returning completely
knocked down by illness, and counting the hours
which would elapse before my arrival at the coast.
The scene was even brighter and more glorious than
when I had left it; but, alas! I scarcely possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
the power to appreciate it, and certainly I could
not enjoy it. Aristides breakfasted with me this
morning, and I killed a sheep and presented him with
the meat. He promised me that, after I had left the
country, he would look after things at Gindar. I
proposed that he should take the eggs from the
guinea-fowl, which abound here, and put them under
hens, so as to bring them up tame; as, if they were
fattened and kept in a civilised state, they would be
excellent eating. I should also like to try the experiment
of introducing rabbits, which I am sure
would do very well, yet perhaps too well, so as to eat
up every green thing.</p>

<p>I started in the afternoon for Massowah, having
arranged that I should be carried to a place called
Maital, on a different road from that which we had
come by, but the usual one for merchants. I reached
Maital about dark, halted for an hour, obtained something
to eat, and slept for awhile; then I lay on
my angareb, and I was carried off again all through
the night. I thought the darkness would never come
to an end, and, towards morning, quite exhausted,
notwithstanding the jolting of the angareb, I fell
asleep, and woke up just at dawn: we were
close to the village of Moncullu. The cocks were
crowing, and some of the people might be seen
moving about. When we arrived here my coolies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
actually began running along with me, and singing
and laughing. These men had been marching for
more than fourteen hours, and during that time had
eaten scarcely anything at all! As I approached
Massowah I saw in the distance a steamer lying in
the harbour; this was indeed a great joy to me, as
now I should speedily get home. I was carried into
Massowah more dead than alive. I went first to
the Divan, and found that Arrekel Bey was away, but
the acting governor knew I was coming, and put
me into some rooms over the telegraph office. M. de
Sarzec, the French Consul, came to see me, after I
had eaten some breakfast; he was very civil and kind,
but he said it was very lucky I had arrived at the time
that I did as the steamer was a day late, and, in the
absence of the Governor, the man who was acting for
him would not have dared to keep the boat waiting.
I dined in the evening with the French Company, a
mercantile house of which M. de Lanfrey is the
manager. They keep all kinds of stores, such as
beads, cotton cloth, silk, sugar, etc., which are sold to
the Abyssinian merchants, who take them up the
country. The dinner was very pleasant, and it was
agreeable to have the opportunity of talking to white
men again, after having led the life of a savage for
some little time.</p>

<p>Before finishing the account of my journey up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Red Sea, I must beg my readers to go back into
Abyssinia with me, and try to follow the sort of sport
my friend H. had been having, and did have, since
we parted. He wrote me a letter, saying that directly
he had received my note from Azho, dated the 12th
of March, and found that I was so ill, he came straight
up from the Mareb, and started off with Fisk and
Brou for Adiaboo. He arrived there on the 15th,
hoping to meet me; but they told him&mdash;which he
was very sorry to hear&mdash;that I was two days in front
of him, and also making long marches in order to
reach Massowah in time for the steamer. He saw it
was useless going on, and so returned that same evening
to Adaajerra, which was better known to us by
the name of Barrakee's village. On his way back he
met with a most unpleasant adventure. It may be
remembered by my readers that, on our former visit,
Zardic, the old chief of Adiaboo, was excessively rude
to us, and we believed it was owing to him that our
donkeys were stolen, and also that so large a price
was charged for the ones that we bought. H. was
travelling quietly along with Fisk and three servants,
when suddenly he heard a yelling and shouting, and
three or four hundred Abyssinians, with Zardic at
their head, rushed down upon them, pulled them off
their mules, and began beating them with sticks and
spears, and poking their guns into their ribs. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
was far from pleasant, and, after it was all over, H.
and his party were more dead than alive. I am afraid
that I was unjustly the cause of this little <i>contretemps</i>,
as Zardic swore that I had knocked down a man at
Azho, and then shot at him, and, as they could not
catch me, because I passed so quickly through
Adiaboo, they thought they would assail H., as they
considered he was just as bad. A few days after the
assault by Zardic and his men, H. wrote to Rass
Baria, the chief of Tigré, a letter of complaint, and,
later on, wrote to the King himself about it. He
subsequently heard there was a tremendous "row"
about all this, and that Zardic was going to be
chained, and the governorship of the province taken
away from him. I think the punishment very just,
and well merited by this chief.</p>

<p>During H.'s first excursion to the Mareb he shot
4 buffaloes, 1 leopard, 1 wadembie (which is a much
larger kind of deer than either hagazin or hartebeest),
also 1 very large turtle, and 2 crocodiles. This was
certainly very good sport, and how I afterwards regretted
I was not able to be with him to swell the
bag! This was before he came up to try and join me
at Adiaboo; when he left Adiaboo, he went to the
Cassoua and Sherraro plains. There he shot 8 tora
(hartebeest), 3 of them being very large and fine
animals, 1 hagazin, and 2 pigs. Also, he says in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
letter to me, that he killed "any number" of small
game, partridges, &amp;c. These plains, according to his
account, swarm with all varieties of antelope, and, in
fact, he seems to have seen a great deal more game
than we did in any other part of Abyssinia. He stayed
there twelve days, and then went back to Barrakee's
village for a day and a half to get flour and provisions
for himself and servants; after which he again went
down to the Mareb, and stayed there till the 11th of
April, and would have remained longer, but the rains
had just begun, and he was afraid of fever. Of course
his great object was to get a lion, and for six successive
nights he sat up watching over an old bullock&mdash;a
beast that we had brought down to the Tackazzee
with us, and one of those which was so nearly drowned
in crossing over that river. On the sixth night a lion
pounced upon the buffalo, and H. shot it as dead as a
door-nail. Naturally he was very pleased, as he very
truly said that he would not have liked to leave Africa
without having shot either a lion or an elephant.
There was great rejoicing in camp next morning
among his servants, as Abyssinians think a great deal
of shooting a lion, although the king of beasts does
not stand so high in scale with them as the elephant.
He said Barrakee stayed with him the whole time, and
turned out a first-rate guide that knew every inch of
the country, and I am sure H. never regretted having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
kept him. He gave him Fisk's gun as a present on
leaving, which delighted him very much. H. had on
one occasion saved his life. Barrakee got knocked
down by a wounded buffalo, and the beast was just
going to trample him to pieces, when H. came up
and shot it dead; the consequence being that Barrakee
was only laid up for a couple of days with a stiff
neck, instead of being gored to death. This man
was, on the whole, the best specimen of an Abyssinian
we had anything to do with while we were in the
country. He had been taught a good deal by the
missionaries, and he remembered the Powell who,
some of my readers may remember, was murdered
by the Shangalla tribe some time ago. Altogether
Barrakee turned out a most useful and faithful servant
to us. In addition to the lion H. shot 8 more buffaloes,
1 wadembie, 12 tora, and some gazelles. On the 11th
of April he started for Adowa. Alas! when he got
there he found that no attention had been paid to the
orders we had given for shields and black leopard
skins. He tried all over the town to get them, but
could not procure one. Rass Baria, who lived at
Adowa, had left, with most of the population of the
town, to join the king, who was fighting a <i>shifter</i>, or
robber, near Dembellas; so nothing could be done,
and the man to whom we had sent the order said he
could not make the shields without the money.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
When H. went to try and see him he found that, like
all the rest, he had gone with Rass Baria to the king.
H. stopped a day at Adowa, and then went straight
on to Massowah.</p>

<p>His bag on the whole, that is to say, of large game,
was as follows: 1 lion, 12 buffaloes, 20 hartebeest,
2 hagazin, 2 wadembie, 1 leopard, 1 large deer with
straight horns, 36 gazelles, 1 very large crocodile,
2 pigs, and an enormous turtle; of course any amount
of guinea fowl and partridges. He says, "As for
hartebeest and buffalo, at Sherraro and on the Mareb,
you can go out and shoot as many as ever you like;
upon my word, they are more like cows than anything
else. I saved all the best heads and skins, and shall
send them home from Suez. I cannot tell you how
glad I am that I went down to the Mareb. Day
after day I watched for elephant and rhinoceros, but
I never even got a shot at one, and as for rhinoceros
I never even saw a track of one." This information
as regards the rhinoceros is rather curious, and only
shows that they must be much farther west, in fact,
in the country which was explored by Sir Samuel
Baker.

FRENCH FRIENDS&mdash;ON BOARD&mdash;COMPARATIVE COMFORT&mdash;A QUEER
FISH&mdash;A DINNER PARTY&mdash;A CARGO OF GAZELLES&mdash;ROUGH WEATHER&mdash;VOYAGE
TO SUEZ&mdash;AND ARRIVAL.
</p>

<p><i>March 27</i>: <i>Massowah</i>.&mdash;I was very ill all night,
and this morning I went to the French Company to
get myself some clothes, as what I had on were
rather curious garments after the journey. I also
bought some stores for the voyage, and two fine
elephants' tusks, which were evidently not Abyssinian
ivory, as they were much too large. The Abyssinian
elephants have very small tusks, and the ivory does
not command a very high price. I was afraid my
donkeys would not come up till after the steamer
had sailed, but M. de Sarzec promised me to have all
my things packed up and sent on. I may as well tell
my readers that eventually everything arrived safe in
England, in as good condition as I left it when last
I saw it in Abyssinia. I lunched with the French
Consul, who entertained us most liberally and produced
some very good "tej," which he makes himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
I went to the French Company's house in the afternoon;
it overlooked the sea, and observing a boat
coming up alongside, I hailed it. An Englishman
was sitting in the stern, who turned out to be Mr.
Cordock, the engineer of the S.S. <i>Massowah</i>. I asked
him to come into the house and speak to me, told him
that I was going away by the steamer to Suez, and
that I had been very ill. The boat was to sail the
next day, so that evening he dined with me at the
French Company's, and we went off to the ship together.
He gave up his cabin to me, and he was
altogether most kind and considerate.</p>

<p>My only fellow-passenger was an ex-French naval
captain, who had been sent out by a mercantile
house in Paris to look for guano amongst the islands
in the Red Sea. He had been cruising about for ten
days in an open native boat, called a sambouk, from
island to island, but had not succeeded in finding
what he wanted, and was now returning to Paris.
He happened to have a servant who was an excellent
cook. This man was half a Syrian and half a
Frenchman, and on the voyage up to Suez he cooked
all our meals for us.</p>

<p><i>March 28, Sunday.</i>&mdash;The ship was to sail to-day,
but there was an additional quantity of hides to
take in. They were gradually crowding up the
deck with this stinking cargo, which had been accumulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
at Massowah for some time, the government
in Egypt not allowing merchants to ship these hides
to Suez, as there was cattle disease at the time in
Abyssinia. I sat on the deck most of the day, enjoying
the cool and pleasant breeze of the harbour.
Just before dinner M. de Sarzec came to see me, and
I persuaded him to stay and dine with us; he was
very entertaining, and he told us a long story of how
he had very nearly been murdered by the natives at
Fogera, in the south of Abyssinia. This is the place
where Consul Plowden, some time before, had been
killed. I wrote letters to K., and gave them to Goubasee
to take to Adowa. I likewise left some
money behind with the French Consul for H., on
his return to Massowah.</p>

<p><i>March 29.</i>&mdash;At daybreak the steamer sailed for
Suez. I was better to-day, as an Arab doctor of
Massowah had given me some opium and ipecacuanha.
This had improved me, as also, probably,
the change to sea air had a great deal to do with it.
The engineer's cabin was on deck, and so I was as
comfortable as I well could be on the dirty little
steamer. I had laid in a stock of provisions at Massowah,
and had also brought down two small sheep
from Asmarra; so with the help of the Syrian cook
we promised not to fare badly.</p>

<p><i>March 30.</i>&mdash;I was a little better this morning, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
during the day, but in the evening after dinner I was
taken dreadfully ill, in fact, I believed I was at the
point of death. The ship anchored for the night, as
is generally the custom with these steamers, the day
after leaving Massowah, for they are cruising about
amongst coral reefs, which are exceedingly dangerous.
Whenever we anchored, the sailors all set to work
fishing, catching numbers of peculiar-shaped and
strange-coloured monsters.</p>

<p><i>March 31.</i>&mdash;I am better to-day, and we all dined
on the upper deck as it was very hot below. We
had a most unusual fish for dinner; he was like a
perch, only perfectly red, and the spiky fin on his
back was of a very beautiful scarlet colour. To-day
the French captain showed me the charts of his
voyages amongst the islands of the Red Sea, which
he had made in an Arab boat with a crew of three
men and his servant. There is a very heavy dew
at night here, but we all three sat talking till late,
Cordock, the engineer, produced some rum, which I
am sorry to say I am not allowed to drink, but the
French captain seemed to enjoy it very much. The
second officer of the ship, an Egyptian of the name of
Hassain, is a very intelligent man; he has been with
ships several times to London, and he talks a little
English.</p>

<p><i>April 1.</i>&mdash;We arrived at Souakim about 9 o'clock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
in the morning, having anchored, for the night
before, inside a reef. I sent for the doctor, Achmet
Effendi, who came to see me. He was a very intelligent
and clever young man, and he spoke French
very well, having been seven years in Paris studying
his profession. Ali Effendi, the agent of the steamship
company, came off to see me; he is a great friend of
A.'s, and seemed a capital good fellow. I gave them
all a little dinner in the evening. The table was
laid on the forecastle, and was lighted up with about
twenty little lamps, which Ali Effendi kindly provided.
Our party consisted of Ali Effendi, the company's
agent; Achmet Effendi, the young doctor;
Mustapha, the captain of the ship; Hassain, the
second officer; the French captain; Mr. Cordock, the
engineer; and myself. Dinner went off capitally, and
our party all seemed to enjoy themselves very much.
They drank all the coffee in the ship that was
ready ground, and ate a large quantity of sweet
things. I sent into the town of Souakim to try and
get a minstrel to enliven us, but the musical instrument
on which he played was broken, the minstrel
was asleep, and the ship's stoker, a Copt, whom I had
sent to fetch him, came back quite drunk. After my
unsuccessful attempt to entertain the company I
went to bed, and I believe the party still went on
drinking coffee and smoking cigars <i>ad libitum</i>. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
here took on board a number of gazelles and
ariels. This is a speculation of an American, named
Philipo, who hopes to sell them for large prices in
Egypt. The animals are housed in pens on the fore
part of the ship and covered over with mats, as what
they suffer from most at sea is cold. I am picking
up Arabic very fast, and I think, in a short time I
should be able to talk like a native. The engineer
nurses me and takes the greatest care of me; in fact,
I do not know what I should do without him.</p>

<p><i>April 2.</i>&mdash;We left Souakim at eight o'clock in the
morning; nothing of importance occurred to-day; we
had head winds and a strong sea.</p>

<p><i>April 3.</i>&mdash;It blew rather hard, and the ship swayed
about. We dined in the engineer's little cabin
amidships, where the motion has not so much effect.
Our cook is prostrated with sea-sickness, as well as
most of the crew; in fact, all these Arab sailors are
generally sick when it comes on to blow. The
engineer, the French captain, and myself were the
only people who had not succumbed to this malady.</p>

<p><i>April 4.</i>&mdash;At sea to-day it blew very hard, and we
made but little way, it was resolved, therefore, that if
it should continue to blow to-morrow we would anchor
inside Ras Benas, a large headland on the west side
of the Red Sea. Here may be seen the ruins of the
old Egyptian town of Berenice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p><i>April 5.</i>&mdash;We were at anchor south of Ras Benas,
and sheltered by the headland, but the captain would
not go near the mainland, as the pilot did not know
that the entrance into the small harbour is here. This
was a great disappointment to me, as I should much
have liked to land and see the ruins of Berenice. The
country is inhabited, and further inland gazelles and
deer are found; there is also some vegetation, including
mimosa bushes. Cordock and I went out in the
evening in the captain's gig to try to catch some fish,
but we only got a good tossing among the reefs, yet
I think the fresh breeze was beneficial to me.</p>

<p><i>April 6.</i>&mdash;We are still at anchor under Ras Benas,
it is blowing so hard. The captain gave us and his
officers a breakfast in Egyptian fashion: it was very
good, some of the dishes being quite original to
me.</p>

<p><i>April 7.</i>&mdash;We weighed anchor at seven o'clock in
the morning, it was blowing very hard, and the
captain wished to stay here till the wind dropped,
but Cordock induced him to go on, as he knew I
was ill and wanted to get home as quickly as
possible. The Arabs are dreadful cowards in a
storm, and when they find themselves in one they
generally begin praying, and doing nothing else. I
was a little stronger, but still very ill with a bad
diarrh&oelig;a.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p><i>April 8.</i>&mdash;We had no chutney to eat with our curry
and rice, so I amused myself to-day by making some.
It resulted in a complete success, and proved very good.
The principal ingredients were some tomatos which the
cook had bought for me at Souakim. At two o'clock
to-day we were abreast of the Brothers, two low coral
islands, and quite chief features of the Red Sea; the
P. &amp; O. Company have put a flag-staff on the larger one.
A gale was blowing very hard, and Cordock hoped to
make Shadwan that night, which is a large island at
the mouth of the Gulf of Suez, with a high mountain
on it that can be seen for thirty miles. I hope to
arrive at Suez on the 10th. It blew so hard, however,
that we could not get on at all, so on the
morning of the 9th we anchored at Tur, after having
passed a very stormy night. When Cordock came to
me in the morning, he informed me that the ship
had very nearly been lost off the island of Shadwan;
it was blowing tremendously hard at the time, and we
were on a lee-shore; the steering-gear gave way, and
the ship went round before the wind. All the Arabs
lost their heads, but Cordock, with the help of his
assistant-engineer and the Syrian cook, put things
right. During all this commotion I was sleeping in
utter unconsciousness in my cabin, and in the morning
I was very glad they had not woke me up. Tur is a
little place on the east side of the Red Sea; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
here that pilgrims and travellers disembark, and get
their camels to start for Mount Sinai.</p>

<p>I went on shore in the afternoon and bought some
provisions at a Greek store there, and by a most unexpected
chance found some of Fortnum and Mason's
preserved soups at this out-of-the-way place; they
had been part of the cargo of a ship that had been
wrecked in the Gulf of Suez. The goods had been
bought by some Greeks of the Suez Bazaar, then
sent down to Tur. I went to see the old Russian
gentleman who makes arrangements for all travellers
to Mount Sinai. I bought some tortoiseshell from
him, and also purchased a pretty good collection of
coral and Red Sea shells from a Greek who was
hanging about, and who also sold me three beautiful
little sponges. Cordock, the French captain, and
I walked out to a grove of date-palm trees not
far off; the mountains in the distance were covered
with a strange purple haze, peculiar to the Red Sea,
and afforded a magnificent appearance. These hills
reminded me very much of the scenery of the background
of some of Gustave Doré's illustrations.</p>

<p><i>April 10.</i>&mdash;We weighed anchor at seven o'clock in
the morning; but it was still very rough. The P. &amp; O.
ship passed us about five <span class="s08">P.M.</span> We had just enough coal
to last us thirty hours, and we had to run one
hundred and twenty-five miles. Thank God! the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
wind dropped, or I cannot guess where we should
have been. We heard at Tur that an English ship
was on the Zafarina reef. They also told us that it
was blowing so hard that ships' boats could not get
ashore from the vessels lying in the roads at Suez.</p>

<p><i>April 11.</i>&mdash;At last I have arrived at the end of my
journey, but more by good luck than good management.
We dropped our anchor at eight o'clock in
the Suez roads, having just got four tons of coal left.
If these had run out we should have had to go back
to Jidda for coal, or else gone ashore in a boat and
trudged up to Suez.</p>

<p>Here my Journal ends. And I hope no other
unhappy mortal who may go travelling in search of
sport will ever have such a journey home as mine has
been.</p>

 General Kirkham was formerly a steward in the P. and O. service.
He left the P. and O. ship in China, to join the British contingent
which Colonel Gordon at that time was raising for the war in China.
General Kirkham was terribly wounded both in the head and shoulder
in this war; he came home, and Sir William Fergusson, the surgeon,
cured him. He afterwards went to Annesley Bay, and, at the time of
the Abyssinian expedition, he was employed by Lord Napier of Magdala
to buy bullocks for commissariat purposes; when the expedition
was over he received leave from Lord Napier to go into Abyssinia. He
tendered his services to the king, and was made a colonel of the
Abyssinian army. Having drilled some Abyssinian soldiers in the
English fashion for the king, in the battle which the king fought
against the rebel Goubasse he gained a well-won reputation, for it
was owing entirely to those men that Johannes the king won this battle.
After this he was made commander-in-chief, which he is now. It may
be remembered by some of my readers that General Kirkham came
home to England on a mission from King Johannes, to claim protection
for Abyssinia from the English Government. This mission
failed, and he returned to Abyssinia.</p>
